Children and adult like to watch anime, and because of bigger audience it has millions of fans across the globe.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Origin</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Japan is considered to be homeland of anime. Back in 1917 Japan artists tried to create first anime. But they had little similarity with what we prefer to watch these days. Without sound, and many frames of animation it was created by drawing characters with chalk. Anime created at the beginning of 20-th Century was destroyed by the following Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and World War II. Most of works were created on cellulose, and as such had not good chances to be saved until this time.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">First steps</h3>|<p class=\"page\">World War II made anime the tool for propaganda. Those animators and studios who didn\'t want to work in that direction were punished and ostracized. But because the society was militarized, anime with propaganda was lucrative during that time. 1945 saw release of full-length anime film Momotaro: Sacred Sailor. After the war Japan anime studios tried to adapt Western style while creating anime. Some of the studios of that time are known until these days. For example, Toie created The Tale of White Serpent in 1958.\r\n </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Osamu Tezuka</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The name of this cartoonist is associated with creating many famous anime that in the following decades set base for modern works. At first Osamu Tezuka work as manga artist, but later he was hired by Toi and animated Son-Goku the Monkey King. After emerging television Tezuka and Mushi Pro created the first anime series with title Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy). The series were about robot who helps to fight alien, criminal and other robots. Series were based on Tezuka\'s manga.\r\n	The work was so successful that it became famous abroad and NBC bought it to show in the USA. Astro Boy had at that time many main features the modern anime has now. For all his works Osamu Tezuka earned the title \"the father of manga\", \"the god of manga\".</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The 1980-th</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The 1980-th is the \"golden age\" of anime. Many anime studios were founded at that time. Anime established itself like distinctive part of Japan culture. Many people whose childhood was within Astro Boy\'s popularity had nostalgia for anime. The VHS gave another reason for popularizing anime.\r\n Our time</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Our time</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Since the beginning of 20-th Century many things have changed. World saw emerging of TV, computer, Internet. Creating anime became quicker and of more quality. The market is oversaturated now with different types of anime that are in free access (in most of cases).\r\n</p>|', '2017-01-10 09:25:18'),

Our life would be at least less comfortable without existing GPS. It allows navigating places we do not know, get information about where we are if we get lost occasionally. Still, there are plenty of cases where the Global Positioning System is used, and about which we do not know.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Segments of GPS</h3>|<p class=\"page\">It is always interesting to know what is inside the things. GPS is not just the satellites that move along their orbits. This system consists of three main parts: satellites that were mentioned before, controlling stations that placed on the lend and receivers that take signals and process them.</p>|<p class=\"page\">GPS has 24 satellites that constantly move along their orbits. The altitude at which they are located is about 20000 kilometers. The satellites were positioned at this altitude due to providing maximum covering of the land. At any time and in any place at least four satellites are available to user. Each satellite has atomic clock and transfers radio signals with constant interval and has its own code. GPS receiver can always determine from what satellite the signal was received. The controlling stations on the lend make corrections of satellite orbits and time on their atomic clocks. GPS receiver is any device that has a clock and can receive radio signals from satellites.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">How does it work?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">For positioning GPS receiver must have several data: position of each satellite (from at least four of them), time of receiving and transferring radio signals. Knowing these data allows GPS receiver to calculate location. Clocks on GPS receiver and satellites make possible to compute time of travelling radio signals from satellites to receivers. Receiver can calculate the distances to each satellite that is accessible at that moment by multiplying time on the light velocity. Using method called triangulation GPS receiver can narrow possible location to 1 - 15 meters.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Sources of GPS errors</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Even though GPS was designed to provide navigational accuracy of 10 to 15 meters, it sometimes fails to give precise location of the objects.  Discrepancies in satellites\' atomic clocks can impact the value of distance to satellite. Multipath interferences caused by objects that refract radio signals can make determining location less precise. Ionospheric interferences can make the signals to slow down or speed up. As a user of GPS receiver you can input incorrect date into it. Orbit errors happen because of gravitational pull and solar pressure fluctuation.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">GPS counterparts</h3>|<p class=\"page\">GPS is not the only such system. There are GLONASS (Russian system), Galileo (European Union project) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (China Positioning System). In the beginning, GLONASS was also intended to be just military project. But now it is also available to everyone who wants to use it. Galileo was created as European project only for civilian use.</p>|', '2017-01-14 09:15:14'),

Being in airport and seeing a whole rank of airplanes, you can involuntary think about the question of why the white color is picked up for airplanes.</p>', '<p class=\"page\">All is very simple. The main reason for such coating is the Sun. As we all know the white color is a reflector of sunlight, and this is very important for airplanes .\r\nAfter landing an airplane runs on low thrust, and it is difficult to ventilate all its parts. So it is no wonder that the body of an airplane is heated up very quickly to high temperature. Only conditioners can change this situation. This is particularly important for the countries that have hot climate. From some sources the white paint is more expensive than black one, from the others it is chipper. Though it is worth mentioning that metal, which has lighter color is more able to become smeary after some time.\r\nBut there are exceptions. Some airlines propose to fly on airplanes that have different colors, for example, green or yellow. Usually, this just for advertising.\r\nBy the way, military airplane is painted in khaki color. The reason for that is a disguise.</p>|', '2017-01-17 11:08:37'),

Servers are powerful, reliable computers that work twenty four hours per day and seven days per week. They are always connected to the Internet, and able to store and send data by request from the other computers, responding in that way on tens and hundreds of requests simultaneously. Clients are personal computers of users in the Internet, on which the request can be composed and sent, data can be received and shown. Often, these computers are not connected to the Internet permanently but connect it by need.\r\n</p>', '<h1 class=\"page\">How the Internet works</h1>', '../images/121232.jpg', '<p class=\"page\">All computers in the Interned can be divided on two big groups:  servers and clients.

Clients are personal computers of users in the Internet, on which the request can be composed and sent, data can be received and shown. Often, these computers are not connected to the Internet permanently but connect it by need.</p>', '<p class=\"page\">For connecting the Internet we address to the service of special companies, which have the name Provider of Internet services. Internet Provider is a company that provides access to the Internet through its servers. User computers connect to server by phone lines, channel or wirelessly. In its turn, servers are connected to the Internet by high-speed lines. User computers have appropriate soft, for example, browsers, which compose and send request to a server, then receive and show information on the computer monitor. Server, on its turn, has its own soft that stores information and respond to the requests of client soft.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Let\'s imagine that different users have different computers, on which different operation systems are set (Windows, Vista etc.) with different browsers (Opera, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). Different servers also have different soft. For correct work of programs that were written by different authors with different operation systems Protocols are needed. It is fair to say that Protocols help computer data exchanging. Every Internet service has its own protocol. For example, if you want to send e-mail, your computer must have program and a server must have soft that is appropriate to your program. Appropriate protocol must provide interaction of user\'s program with server. Thereby, for using any Internet services we need:</p>|<ul><li>-computer;\r\n</li><li>-user\'s program that is set on computer and able to work with a service protocol;\r\n</li><li>-server address which has appropriate soft</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">For simplification all aforementioned information let\'s suppose that one person from France want to have conversation with Bill from the USA. For providing communication you have to be sure that two of them know the same language (for example, English). But knowing just basic of the language is not enough. They must be able to organize all words in correct way, according to the rules. Only in that case Bill can understand a person from France. Computers use similar concept when they must find appropriate address. Each computer in the Internet has its unique IP address that has four number sequences from 0 to 255. It is possible to find a computer in any part of the World by using IP. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">If websites, blogs, etc. are part of World Wide Web, then where are they located? How can computer get there? Usually websites are stored on servers, so the servers have extensive disc space, required soft, and ability to respond on tens and hundreds requests simultaneously. For hosting a website in the Internet you need a Provider. Host Provider is a company that provides hosting service,  gives disc space on server for storing websites in the Internet. Remember, that hosting is not a process of website publication but lending of disc space. For finding any website on WWW you need to know IP address of a server, on which a website is stored. There are no problems for computer to remember  IP addresses in the form of number sequences. For people it is more difficult. Domain Name System brings more simplicity to make that work done. This is an alternative address system that understandable for people because computers are assigned not only IP address but also symbolic domain name. Domain name is symbol sequence that divided by period. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Although domain names are very handy for people, computers use number addresses. So for providing interaction between human and machine DNS server service was created. DNS server is a program that performs converting domain name into IP address and opposite. Very likely, you can compare DNS server with the address book on your mobile. We physically cannot remember all numbers that we need. So we write every number on the address book using unique name. For calling we find the name we need and a phone calculate what number must be called. The same method is used on DNS server.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">How can required data be found and transferred? World Wide Web has million different documents that are stored on servers and the task is finding and reading required document. For this, our browser must know exact location of document. All users well know that address consists of short name beginning with disc name and ending with directory names which divided by slash \"/\". So we definitely identify file on computer.\r\nEach file in the Internet also has its unique address. It has a name URL. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is universal resource locator or address of any file on the Internet. Except address of computer URL contains directive about which protocol must be used for requesting a file and what program to use on a server. Commonly, URL address made up of three principal elements: Protocol, Domain name, file path. Let\'s analyze in detail the following URL  http://videofun.com/dns/service/dns-serv.html:\r\n</p>|<ul><li>-http is a protocol. It defines the rules for the interaction between client and server. Protocol has a name HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP;\r\n</li><li>-A domain name of a server follows after that. In our case this is videofun.com., where .com is high level domain;</li>\r\n</li><li>-dns/service/dns-serv.html is a path to our file, which is in directory dns-serv.html.</li></ul>|', '2017-01-20 08:57:21'),

In another words, we are sad about something particular. This is also means that when situation changes and the reason for our emotional pain disappears or we fix the situation or put up with it, a sadness fades away. Depression is an abnormal emotional state, which impacts our thinking, emotions, our perception and behavior in different situations. When we are in depression, we are sad about all. A depression is not always triggered by difficult events or situation, changed circumstances. In fact, depression rises when there is no visible reason for it. The life seems to be normal, but you feel yourself awful. Depression erases all colors from your life, makes all less interesting and enjoyable. Depression undermines your energy, motivation and ability to experience joy, pleasure, excitement, satisfaction, affection and love. When you are in depression you become inpatient, loose control of yourself, get angry or upset more quickly and you need more time for getting over all that. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Symptoms of depression</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Professionals consider anyone possessing at least 5 from the following symptoms during continuous period of time as clinically depressed.

You should remember that human being can make errors, be careless and as a result text in the Word can have bad appearance. To see all errors you can type Ctrl+*. This combination of keys makes the program to show all non-printed symbols that usually are hidden from view. Formatting is another common reason of why you have some additional spaces. You can fix this by going to the text setting. If you look at the ribbon on the home tab, you can spot icons with small line placed close to each other on the paragraph group. There are four of them. You can choose the alignment style by typing one of the icons. You can play with them to understand their functions. Actually, it is not very difficult, and makes you feel more accustomed to text alignment in the Word. You can choose to justify a text on a page. In that case, text will be aligned along the left and right margins. So in some cases the spaces between the words can be large, and  text can look slightly strange. For fixing this you can select the paragraph that you want to change and choose left alignment. Another reason for big spacing is typing tab key. You can accidently type the tab key. In that case, you have bigger spacing. Type the combination Ctrl+* for spotting all hidden symbols. In that way, you can understand where on the text you have bigger spacing and what the reason for this. Find and delete the tab characters that look like arrow. \r\n</p>|', '2017-01-30 08:41:05'),

Each application that was downloaded from the Internet can be restored.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What are the options for backing up PC?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can backup the files using two methods: onsite and offsite. First one is using external drive for backup. It is fast and easy. But in the case of fire or robbery you can loose all your data. Offsite backup is when your files are stored in different places, for example, on server. For this backup you can use special services. One example of such service is Crash Plan. Also, you can store your data on external drive and pass it to your friend or put it in bank safe. It will be offsite backup. Finally, you can use cloud service for backing up your files. Each method has its pro and cons. </p>|<p class=\"page\">Backing up files using external drive is the fastest and easiest way. You can use for this any hard drive that is big enough to store all your important file several times. For backup you can use built-in Windows\' utility but it provides you with bare minimum. To do it better use special software that allows to perform full, incremental and differential backup. Each backup has differences. Full backup saves every piece of information, including folders, files, and applications. Differential backups save the files that were changed since the last backup. Good backup applications are Genie Backup Manager, Acronis Backup for PC, Nova BACKUP.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Using online backup service is good option, but it will cost you at least 5$ per month. But if you buy any, you\'ll be provided with all software and automatic backing your files.</p>|<p class=\"page\">To save your money, you can use cloud services like Google Drive, MicrosoftOneDrive, Dropbox. But in that case you can only save your file on the server. These services is not for backup and you  can not have automatic backup, and programs that will be running in background and create point of restoring. Also you have not enough (in the case of using service for free) space for saving all you want.</p>|', '2017-02-05 08:23:42'),

He used different ways for inventing new words and phrases, but the result was always stunning. Sounding from the monologs of colorful characters the words became those words and quotes that we use in our day. Shakespeare\'s significance in the time of great transforming of English was in enriching the language, extending its vocabulary and creating new words and phrases. In time when language was not standardized and had not formed in the way we used to see it now, Shakespeare\'s works had significant impact.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Shakespeare\'s legacy in modern English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Have you ever wonder how many words and phrases that were created by Shakespeare you use in daily life? Unwittingly you can use some of his words or even phrases from his plays. It is amazing how many his quotes are used even in our day. Without some of them our English would be less vivid and diverse. For example, we hardly would describe the scenes of serial killer without the word \"cold-blooded\" and your show about vampires would be less deep. The week could not be eventful without Shakespeare creativity and your wedding is just a stage of your life, but not auspicious occasion on which you wait. Have you ever used the words \"fashionable\" in the collocations like \"a fashionable dress\", \"a fashionable hotel\", \"a fashionable cafe\", \"a fashionable style\"? All these collocations would not be possible without word \"fashionable\" or at least would sound strange. Firstly the word \"fashionable\" emerged in Shakespeare\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\".\r\nThere are many other examples:</p>|<ul><li>-be \"in a pickle\" - means be in trouble;\r\n</li><li>-\"to much of good things\" - means that \"to much of good things\" is not always good for you;\r\n</li><li>\"clothes make the man\" - means that clothes impact the way people will see you as a person;\r\n</li><li>-\"break the ice\" - beginning of conversation with someone who you see the first time;\r\n</li><li>-\"fair play\" - means play while following all rules (in the sport)</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be continued. As you can see from words and phrases, they are used pretty frequently in our daily life, not mention about quotes that are used also very often. </p>|', '2017-02-10 08:18:36'),

It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h1 class=\"page\">How to find and delete duplicate files on your computer</h1>', '../images/885422.jpg', '<p class=\"page\">Each of us at least once stumbled with the problem of slow working computer. It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the duplicate files?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Duplicate files are the files that are copies of other files. Format of files can be different: text, music, picture, etc. Sizes of duplicates can vary.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Why does it happen?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Not only you chip in creating duplicate files on your computer, but Windows also makes identical copies of the same files. It makes operating system more stable and reliable while malware may change some critical files. Some malware can change system files and make your Windows unbootable. For this does not happen Windows has System File Protection. Its main goal is to prevent these changes from harming of operating system and making it unbootable in the end. System File Protection always has a back up of system files, that is, actually, identical copy of files. When some system files are deleted, System File Protection restores the original copies of these files. Many programs also might give duplicate files while installing or updating. It happens because program wants to make itself more reliable by creating its library. For example, some part of library of one program might be identical to the library of another program. But each program wants to install its own version of library, because changes in library (in the case of using the same part of library by two or more programs) might harm another program. It results in creating duplicate files. While updating, apps can also create new versions with  duplicate files. All this changes happen without our knowing and acting. But we also can create duplicate files. We can download the same file twice or copy the same file into different folders, drives.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the solution?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can find duplicate files manually and delete them. But such work is hardly productive and takes your precious time. Also, you cannot quickly distinguish between the files that are similar. But they  might be the copies of the same file, taking free space from your computer. Better solution is using special programs that can find and delete duplicate files. </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the best app to solve the problem?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The app that can find and delete duplicate files must have the following features:</p>|<ul><li>-be free to use or at least have free version that you can use;\r\n</li><li>-be without additional programs like installing toolbar or changing your search engine on browser;\r\n</li><li>-be easy to use;\r\n</li><li>-be free from malware</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">It is obvious there are plenty of different programs out there that you can use for solution to the problem with duplicate files. But you cannot use many of them because they are paid apps or have additional programs. \r\nOne of the programs that you can use for this purpose is dupeGuru. It is free to use and does not install junkware on your computer. It is easy to use and you can quickly understand what to do from beginning. To start your scanning you must add a few folders, and click scan. dupeGuru has dupe Guru Music Edition and dupe Guru Pictures Edition. As their names suggest, each one has its own purpose. You\'ll be much more comfortable when searching duplicate image files by using dupe Guru Pictures Edition. When you want to search for duplicate music files, it is better to use Music Edition.</p>|', '2017-02-22 07:59:38'),

Usual aspect of every modern city like skyscrapers can hardly be seen in Washington, DC. But you can see from almost every place of the city that it consists of squat structures. They are wide but not tall. It becomes more stunning when you think that this is the capital of country which is famous for putting man on the Moon and creating the Internet. To be honest, except one applied for skyscraper, all other modern technologies were used for creating buildings in Washington, DC. As a result, the residents have underground garages and modern offices, but all this is packed in low-height buildings.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">The cause of Washington\'s particular architecture</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The reason the Washington has not tall structures like many other American cities is the Height of Buildings Act that was enacted by Congress in 1910. Actually, before that document there was another version of this paper in 1889. Both of them were created as response to building of Cairo hotel, which had 14 stories. The latest version of act (1910) is valid until these days and restricts the height of any building to be higher than the width of adjacent street plus 20 feet up to a maximum of 90 feet on residential street, 130 feet on commercial street, and 160 feet on a small portion of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Two views on the problem</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Despite that restriction remains in force until these days and most of the buildings were created within the time of its validity, there have been many attempts to remove the Height of Buildings Act. There are many reasons for removing or at least relaxing this document.</p>|<p class=\"page\">In the terms of housing prices, hotel rooms Washington, DC can be at the top of list that represents the most expensive cities. This affects every part of life in the city making it affordable only for those who are related to politic sphere or business. Because of that, working class moves from the city to its neighbor environs. For the same reason tourism struggles to become profitable enough. Deleting any restrictions about height of the buildings would lower prices for hotel rooms and rent of offices allowing more people to move in the city. Having more residents could create more jobs in different areas and low prices for services.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Fans of opposite view have other thoughts about architecture of the city. Modern high buildings create the lists of unwanted inconveniences such as hindering of daylight on the streets, wind tunnels and making the skyline of the city uglier. The absence of skyscrapers in Washington for their view brings to the capital the ambience of Paris.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The future</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Talking about Washington, it\'s worth to mention other capitals like London or Berlin that despite being centers for political life became also business and culture hearts. It\'s obvious that city lacks high building that would make it more business oriented. Whit that, many people would have more opportunities while living in Washington.</p>|', '2017-02-27 07:43:09'),

Maybe, you have already used it for getting to place you needed. It is very helpful and convenient in these cases. But how does it work?</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Global Positioning System</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Global Positioning System or GPS is a network that consists of 30 satellites and broadcasts radio signals with interval. Everyone who has GPS receiver (for example, sell phone) and is located along the lines of sight to at least three satellites can use GPS for navigation or determination location. The more satellites are available for your receiver, the more precise would be data about your location. But once you enter a building, you can lose your contact with GPS. It happens because radio signals can be attenuated by the materials of the buildings like concrete and iron. The signal from GPS in this case will be scattered by the elements of the building: roof, walls, and ceiling.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Indoor solutions</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Because GPS does not work or does not provide required preciseness inside buildings, indoor solutions were invented. It was logically predictable, because at least 80% of their time human beings spend indoors, and Indoor Positioning Systems are in need for many spheres of business. At that time there is no standard technology that is used for such solutions. Different companies try to implement their own solution for this task. Very likely, for such solutions already existing technology will be used. Another important point is that for receiving precise data about location of individual or object more than one technology must be used. Many solutions use Wi-Fi access points for locating and navigating. But in that case data will be precise only if ideal conditions were created, because receiver must be placed on crossing of unobstructed straight lines to three access points. This is in the case a technology uses trilateration for determining location. Other technologies use Bluetooth Low Energy for determining location. For example, an Apple\'s positioning system uses Bluetooth Low Energy to contact transmitters and collect data about location of an object. This technology (iBeacon) requires additional hardware (transmitters) and qualified personals for setting it. No matter what type of technology is used in Indoor Positioning System, it needs precise map of building with determining all floors. In the case of using Wi-Fi access points it needs also precise specifying of those points on map.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Cases for using Indoor Positioning Systems</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Indoor Positioning Systems may be used in the following cases:</p>|<ul><li>-location of individuals or objects;\r</li><li>-navigation;\r</li><li>-helping people with impaired view;\r</li><li>-in emergency cases;\r</li><li>-for enhancing security of a building;\r</li><li>-for providing the customers with just-in-time information they need;\r</li><li>-for guiding customers to places they need;\r</li><li>-for gathering information</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be bigger and using Indoor Positioning Solutions might be beneficial in many other cases. Within some time these technologies have all chances to become as ubiquitous as GPS that was created like military project but became  an important part of our life.</p>|', '2017-03-01 11:02:47');

Back in 1917 Japan artists tried to create first anime. But they had little similarity with what we prefer to watch these days. Without sound, and many frames of animation it was created by drawing characters with chalk. Anime created at the beginning of 20-th Century was destroyed by the following Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and World War II. Most of works were created on cellulose, and as such had not good chances to be saved until this time.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">First steps</h3>|<p class=\"page\">World War II made anime the tool for propaganda. Those animators and studios who didn\'t want to work in that direction were punished and ostracized. But because the society was militarized, anime with propaganda was lucrative during that time. 1945 saw release of full-length anime film Momotaro: Sacred Sailor. After the war Japan anime studios tried to adapt Western style while creating anime. Some of the studios of that time are known until these days. For example, Toie created The Tale of White Serpent in 1958.\r\n </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Osamu Tezuka</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The name of this cartoonist is associated with creating many famous anime that in the following decades set base for modern works. At first Osamu Tezuka work as manga artist, but later he was hired by Toi and animated Son-Goku the Monkey King. After emerging television Tezuka and Mushi Pro created the first anime series with title Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy). The series were about robot who helps to fight alien, criminal and other robots. Series were based on Tezuka\'s manga.\r\n	The work was so successful that it became famous abroad and NBC bought it to show in the USA. Astro Boy had at that time many main features the modern anime has now. For all his works Osamu Tezuka earned the title \"the father of manga\", \"the god of manga\".</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The 1980-th</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The 1980-th is the \"golden age\" of anime. Many anime studios were founded at that time. Anime established itself like distinctive part of Japan culture. Many people whose childhood was within Astro Boy\'s popularity had nostalgia for anime. The VHS gave another reason for popularizing anime.\r\n Our time</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Our time</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Since the beginning of 20-th Century many things have changed. World saw emerging of TV, computer, Internet. Creating anime became quicker and of more quality.

GPS is not just the satellites that move along their orbits. This system consists of three main parts: satellites that were mentioned before, controlling stations that placed on the lend and receivers that take signals and process them.</p>|<p class=\"page\">GPS has 24 satellites that constantly move along their orbits. The altitude at which they are located is about 20000 kilometers. The satellites were positioned at this altitude due to providing maximum covering of the land. At any time and in any place at least four satellites are available to user. Each satellite has atomic clock and transfers radio signals with constant interval and has its own code. GPS receiver can always determine from what satellite the signal was received. The controlling stations on the lend make corrections of satellite orbits and time on their atomic clocks. GPS receiver is any device that has a clock and can receive radio signals from satellites.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">How does it work?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">For positioning GPS receiver must have several data: position of each satellite (from at least four of them), time of receiving and transferring radio signals. Knowing these data allows GPS receiver to calculate location. Clocks on GPS receiver and satellites make possible to compute time of travelling radio signals from satellites to receivers. Receiver can calculate the distances to each satellite that is accessible at that moment by multiplying time on the light velocity. Using method called triangulation GPS receiver can narrow possible location to 1 - 15 meters.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Sources of GPS errors</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Even though GPS was designed to provide navigational accuracy of 10 to 15 meters, it sometimes fails to give precise location of the objects.  Discrepancies in satellites\' atomic clocks can impact the value of distance to satellite. Multipath interferences caused by objects that refract radio signals can make determining location less precise. Ionospheric interferences can make the signals to slow down or speed up. As a user of GPS receiver you can input incorrect date into it. Orbit errors happen because of gravitational pull and solar pressure fluctuation.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">GPS counterparts</h3>|<p class=\"page\">GPS is not the only such system. There are GLONASS (Russian system), Galileo (European Union project) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (China Positioning System). In the beginning, GLONASS was also intended to be just military project. But now it is also available to everyone who wants to use it. Galileo was created as European project only for civilian use.</p>|', '2017-01-14 09:15:14'),

So it is no wonder that the body of an airplane is heated up very quickly to high temperature. Only conditioners can change this situation. This is particularly important for the countries that have hot climate. From some sources the white paint is more expensive than black one, from the others it is chipper. Though it is worth mentioning that metal, which has lighter color is more able to become smeary after some time.\r\nBut there are exceptions. Some airlines propose to fly on airplanes that have different colors, for example, green or yellow. Usually, this just for advertising.\r\nBy the way, military airplane is painted in khaki color.

Internet Provider is a company that provides access to the Internet through its servers. User computers connect to server by phone lines, channel or wirelessly. In its turn, servers are connected to the Internet by high-speed lines. User computers have appropriate soft, for example, browsers, which compose and send request to a server, then receive and show information on the computer monitor. Server, on its turn, has its own soft that stores information and respond to the requests of client soft.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Let\'s imagine that different users have different computers, on which different operation systems are set (Windows, Vista etc.) with different browsers (Opera, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). Different servers also have different soft. For correct work of programs that were written by different authors with different operation systems Protocols are needed. It is fair to say that Protocols help computer data exchanging. Every Internet service has its own protocol. For example, if you want to send e-mail, your computer must have program and a server must have soft that is appropriate to your program. Appropriate protocol must provide interaction of user\'s program with server. Thereby, for using any Internet services we need:</p>|<ul><li>-computer;\r\n</li><li>-user\'s program that is set on computer and able to work with a service protocol;\r\n</li><li>-server address which has appropriate soft</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">For simplification all aforementioned information let\'s suppose that one person from France want to have conversation with Bill from the USA. For providing communication you have to be sure that two of them know the same language (for example, English). But knowing just basic of the language is not enough. They must be able to organize all words in correct way, according to the rules. Only in that case Bill can understand a person from France. Computers use similar concept when they must find appropriate address. Each computer in the Internet has its unique IP address that has four number sequences from 0 to 255. It is possible to find a computer in any part of the World by using IP. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">If websites, blogs, etc. are part of World Wide Web, then where are they located? How can computer get there? Usually websites are stored on servers, so the servers have extensive disc space, required soft, and ability to respond on tens and hundreds requests simultaneously. For hosting a website in the Internet you need a Provider. Host Provider is a company that provides hosting service,  gives disc space on server for storing websites in the Internet. Remember, that hosting is not a process of website publication but lending of disc space. For finding any website on WWW you need to know IP address of a server, on which a website is stored. There are no problems for computer to remember  IP addresses in the form of number sequences. For people it is more difficult. Domain Name System brings more simplicity to make that work done. This is an alternative address system that understandable for people because computers are assigned not only IP address but also symbolic domain name. Domain name is symbol sequence that divided by period. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Although domain names are very handy for people, computers use number addresses. So for providing interaction between human and machine DNS server service was created. DNS server is a program that performs converting domain name into IP address and opposite. Very likely, you can compare DNS server with the address book on your mobile. We physically cannot remember all numbers that we need. So we write every number on the address book using unique name. For calling we find the name we need and a phone calculate what number must be called. The same method is used on DNS server.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">How can required data be found and transferred? World Wide Web has million different documents that are stored on servers and the task is finding and reading required document. For this, our browser must know exact location of document. All users well know that address consists of short name beginning with disc name and ending with directory names which divided by slash \"/\". So we definitely identify file on computer.\r\nEach file in the Internet also has its unique address. It has a name URL. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is universal resource locator or address of any file on the Internet. Except address of computer URL contains directive about which protocol must be used for requesting a file and what program to use on a server. Commonly, URL address made up of three principal elements: Protocol, Domain name, file path. Let\'s analyze in detail the following URL  http://videofun.com/dns/service/dns-serv.html:\r\n</p>|<ul><li>-http is a protocol. It defines the rules for the interaction between client and server.

And this is a big issue. The widespread ignorance of people in this case can lead to neglecting serious psychological disorder, which must be treated. Sadness is a normal human emotion that we all experience in our life on and on.  Usually, sadness is caused by difficulties, complex events or disappointment.  In another words, we are sad about something particular. This is also means that when situation changes and the reason for our emotional pain disappears or we fix the situation or put up with it, a sadness fades away. Depression is an abnormal emotional state, which impacts our thinking, emotions, our perception and behavior in different situations. When we are in depression, we are sad about all. A depression is not always triggered by difficult events or situation, changed circumstances. In fact, depression rises when there is no visible reason for it. The life seems to be normal, but you feel yourself awful. Depression erases all colors from your life, makes all less interesting and enjoyable. Depression undermines your energy, motivation and ability to experience joy, pleasure, excitement, satisfaction, affection and love. When you are in depression you become inpatient, loose control of yourself, get angry or upset more quickly and you need more time for getting over all that. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Symptoms of depression</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Professionals consider anyone possessing at least 5 from the following symptoms during continuous period of time as clinically depressed.

You should remember that human being can make errors, be careless and as a result text in the Word can have bad appearance. To see all errors you can type Ctrl+*. This combination of keys makes the program to show all non-printed symbols that usually are hidden from view. Formatting is another common reason of why you have some additional spaces. You can fix this by going to the text setting. If you look at the ribbon on the home tab, you can spot icons with small line placed close to each other on the paragraph group. There are four of them. You can choose the alignment style by typing one of the icons. You can play with them to understand their functions. Actually, it is not very difficult, and makes you feel more accustomed to text alignment in the Word. You can choose to justify a text on a page. In that case, text will be aligned along the left and right margins. So in some cases the spaces between the words can be large, and  text can look slightly strange. For fixing this you can select the paragraph that you want to change and choose left alignment. Another reason for big spacing is typing tab key. You can accidently type the tab key. In that case, you have bigger spacing. Type the combination Ctrl+* for spotting all hidden symbols. In that way, you can understand where on the text you have bigger spacing and what the reason for this. Find and delete the tab characters that look like arrow. \r\n</p>|', '2017-01-30 08:41:05'),

You can lose your personal files as a result of activity these malicious programs or crash of your hard drive. Even though some people think that this is something that can not happen with them, this is very real. And if you visualize this, you can see that this can be a disaster. To prevent this from happening or (it\'s right to say) to minimize the consequences of loosing your data, you can make backup of the files you think are important for you.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the files  worth backing up?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">When backing up your computer, you might consider the option of storing not all information from your PC. Actually, you must backup only the files that cannot be restored. It can be only your personal files, because other information can be restored from the Internet. But you hardly will be able to restore your photos from travel last year or video from party which was just in one copy on your PC. Each application that was downloaded from the Internet can be restored.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What are the options for backing up PC?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can backup the files using two methods: onsite and offsite. First one is using external drive for backup. It is fast and easy. But in the case of fire or robbery you can loose all your data. Offsite backup is when your files are stored in different places, for example, on server. For this backup you can use special services. One example of such service is Crash Plan. Also, you can store your data on external drive and pass it to your friend or put it in bank safe. It will be offsite backup. Finally, you can use cloud service for backing up your files. Each method has its pro and cons. </p>|<p class=\"page\">Backing up files using external drive is the fastest and easiest way. You can use for this any hard drive that is big enough to store all your important file several times. For backup you can use built-in Windows\' utility but it provides you with bare minimum. To do it better use special software that allows to perform full, incremental and differential backup. Each backup has differences. Full backup saves every piece of information, including folders, files, and applications. Differential backups save the files that were changed since the last backup. Good backup applications are Genie Backup Manager, Acronis Backup for PC, Nova BACKUP.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Using online backup service is good option, but it will cost you at least 5$ per month. But if you buy any, you\'ll be provided with all software and automatic backing your files.</p>|<p class=\"page\">To save your money, you can use cloud services like Google Drive, MicrosoftOneDrive, Dropbox. But in that case you can only save your file on the server. These services is not for backup and you  can not have automatic backup, and programs that will be running in background and create point of restoring. Also you have not enough (in the case of using service for free) space for saving all you want.</p>|', '2017-02-05 08:23:42'),

His influence extends far beyond just his plays. His legacy impacted English literature and theatre. The characters of his plays were unforgettable and their monologs brought to the public plenty of famous quotes, which we can use nowadays even without knowing their origin. Just imagine: this man lived four cunturies ago, but his words and phrases are used in our speech. There is no doubts, English would be different without Shakespeare\'s \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Macbeth\" or \"Hamlet\". And for sure, we would not be able to express our thoughts in such a vivid way that we do using modern English. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Standardization of English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Shakespeare lived in the time when language was not standardized. It meant that there were not established grammar, vocabulary and spelling. Obviously, the language had a lack of words and phrases, so the writers of that time were forced to invent them or borrow from other languages. In that situation, Shakespeare tryed to create the greatest of his works. Not only he succeded in that, but did also immensly expanded the scope of English literature. He used different ways for inventing new words and phrases, but the result was always stunning. Sounding from the monologs of colorful characters the words became those words and quotes that we use in our day. Shakespeare\'s significance in the time of great transforming of English was in enriching the language, extending its vocabulary and creating new words and phrases. In time when language was not standardized and had not formed in the way we used to see it now, Shakespeare\'s works had significant impact.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Shakespeare\'s legacy in modern English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Have you ever wonder how many words and phrases that were created by Shakespeare you use in daily life? Unwittingly you can use some of his words or even phrases from his plays. It is amazing how many his quotes are used even in our day. Without some of them our English would be less vivid and diverse. For example, we hardly would describe the scenes of serial killer without the word \"cold-blooded\" and your show about vampires would be less deep. The week could not be eventful without Shakespeare creativity and your wedding is just a stage of your life, but not auspicious occasion on which you wait. Have you ever used the words \"fashionable\" in the collocations like \"a fashionable dress\", \"a fashionable hotel\", \"a fashionable cafe\", \"a fashionable style\"? All these collocations would not be possible without word \"fashionable\" or at least would sound strange. Firstly the word \"fashionable\" emerged in Shakespeare\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\".\r\nThere are many other examples:</p>|<ul><li>-be \"in a pickle\" - means be in trouble;\r\n</li><li>-\"to much of good things\" - means that \"to much of good things\" is not always good for you;\r\n</li><li>\"clothes make the man\" - means that clothes impact the way people will see you as a person;\r\n</li><li>-\"break the ice\" - beginning of conversation with someone who you see the first time;\r\n</li><li>-\"fair play\" - means play while following all rules (in the sport)</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be continued.

It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the duplicate files?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Duplicate files are the files that are copies of other files. Format of files can be different: text, music, picture, etc. Sizes of duplicates can vary.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Why does it happen?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Not only you chip in creating duplicate files on your computer, but Windows also makes identical copies of the same files. It makes operating system more stable and reliable while malware may change some critical files. Some malware can change system files and make your Windows unbootable. For this does not happen Windows has System File Protection. Its main goal is to prevent these changes from harming of operating system and making it unbootable in the end. System File Protection always has a back up of system files, that is, actually, identical copy of files. When some system files are deleted, System File Protection restores the original copies of these files. Many programs also might give duplicate files while installing or updating. It happens because program wants to make itself more reliable by creating its library. For example, some part of library of one program might be identical to the library of another program. But each program wants to install its own version of library, because changes in library (in the case of using the same part of library by two or more programs) might harm another program. It results in creating duplicate files. While updating, apps can also create new versions with  duplicate files. All this changes happen without our knowing and acting. But we also can create duplicate files. We can download the same file twice or copy the same file into different folders, drives.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the solution?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can find duplicate files manually and delete them. But such work is hardly productive and takes your precious time. Also, you cannot quickly distinguish between the files that are similar. But they  might be the copies of the same file, taking free space from your computer. Better solution is using special programs that can find and delete duplicate files. </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the best app to solve the problem?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The app that can find and delete duplicate files must have the following features:</p>|<ul><li>-be free to use or at least have free version that you can use;\r\n</li><li>-be without additional programs like installing toolbar or changing your search engine on browser;\r\n</li><li>-be easy to use;\r\n</li><li>-be free from malware</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">It is obvious there are plenty of different programs out there that you can use for solution to the problem with duplicate files. But you cannot use many of them because they are paid apps or have additional programs. \r\nOne of the programs that you can use for this purpose is dupeGuru. It is free to use and does not install junkware on your computer. It is easy to use and you can quickly understand what to do from beginning. To start your scanning you must add a few folders, and click scan. dupeGuru has dupe Guru Music Edition and dupe Guru Pictures Edition. As their names suggest, each one has its own purpose. You\'ll be much more comfortable when searching duplicate image files by using dupe Guru Pictures Edition. When you want to search for duplicate music files, it is better to use Music Edition.</p>|', '2017-02-22 07:59:38'),

To be honest, except one applied for skyscraper, all other modern technologies were used for creating buildings in Washington, DC. As a result, the residents have underground garages and modern offices, but all this is packed in low-height buildings.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">The cause of Washington\'s particular architecture</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The reason the Washington has not tall structures like many other American cities is the Height of Buildings Act that was enacted by Congress in 1910. Actually, before that document there was another version of this paper in 1889. Both of them were created as response to building of Cairo hotel, which had 14 stories. The latest version of act (1910) is valid until these days and restricts the height of any building to be higher than the width of adjacent street plus 20 feet up to a maximum of 90 feet on residential street, 130 feet on commercial street, and 160 feet on a small portion of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Two views on the problem</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Despite that restriction remains in force until these days and most of the buildings were created within the time of its validity, there have been many attempts to remove the Height of Buildings Act. There are many reasons for removing or at least relaxing this document.</p>|<p class=\"page\">In the terms of housing prices, hotel rooms Washington, DC can be at the top of list that represents the most expensive cities. This affects every part of life in the city making it affordable only for those who are related to politic sphere or business. Because of that, working class moves from the city to its neighbor environs. For the same reason tourism struggles to become profitable enough. Deleting any restrictions about height of the buildings would lower prices for hotel rooms and rent of offices allowing more people to move in the city. Having more residents could create more jobs in different areas and low prices for services.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Fans of opposite view have other thoughts about architecture of the city. Modern high buildings create the lists of unwanted inconveniences such as hindering of daylight on the streets, wind tunnels and making the skyline of the city uglier. The absence of skyscrapers in Washington for their view brings to the capital the ambience of Paris.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The future</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Talking about Washington, it\'s worth to mention other capitals like London or Berlin that despite being centers for political life became also business and culture hearts. It\'s obvious that city lacks high building that would make it more business oriented. Whit that, many people would have more opportunities while living in Washington.</p>|', '2017-02-27 07:43:09'),

Everyone who has GPS receiver (for example, sell phone) and is located along the lines of sight to at least three satellites can use GPS for navigation or determination location. The more satellites are available for your receiver, the more precise would be data about your location. But once you enter a building, you can lose your contact with GPS. It happens because radio signals can be attenuated by the materials of the buildings like concrete and iron. The signal from GPS in this case will be scattered by the elements of the building: roof, walls, and ceiling.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Indoor solutions</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Because GPS does not work or does not provide required preciseness inside buildings, indoor solutions were invented. It was logically predictable, because at least 80% of their time human beings spend indoors, and Indoor Positioning Systems are in need for many spheres of business. At that time there is no standard technology that is used for such solutions. Different companies try to implement their own solution for this task. Very likely, for such solutions already existing technology will be used. Another important point is that for receiving precise data about location of individual or object more than one technology must be used. Many solutions use Wi-Fi access points for locating and navigating. But in that case data will be precise only if ideal conditions were created, because receiver must be placed on crossing of unobstructed straight lines to three access points. This is in the case a technology uses trilateration for determining location. Other technologies use Bluetooth Low Energy for determining location. For example, an Apple\'s positioning system uses Bluetooth Low Energy to contact transmitters and collect data about location of an object. This technology (iBeacon) requires additional hardware (transmitters) and qualified personals for setting it. No matter what type of technology is used in Indoor Positioning System, it needs precise map of building with determining all floors. In the case of using Wi-Fi access points it needs also precise specifying of those points on map.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Cases for using Indoor Positioning Systems</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Indoor Positioning Systems may be used in the following cases:</p>|<ul><li>-location of individuals or objects;\r</li><li>-navigation;\r</li><li>-helping people with impaired view;\r</li><li>-in emergency cases;\r</li><li>-for enhancing security of a building;\r</li><li>-for providing the customers with just-in-time information they need;\r</li><li>-for guiding customers to places they need;\r</li><li>-for gathering information</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be bigger and using Indoor Positioning Solutions might be beneficial in many other cases. Within some time these technologies have all chances to become as ubiquitous as GPS that was created like military project but became  an important part of our life.</p>|', '2017-03-01 11:02:47');

There are also exaggerations in their physical features: big eyes, larger and brighter face. Children and adult like to watch anime, and because of bigger audience it has millions of fans across the globe.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Origin</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Japan is considered to be homeland of anime. Back in 1917 Japan artists tried to create first anime. But they had little similarity with what we prefer to watch these days. Without sound, and many frames of animation it was created by drawing characters with chalk. Anime created at the beginning of 20-th Century was destroyed by the following Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and World War II. Most of works were created on cellulose, and as such had not good chances to be saved until this time.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">First steps</h3>|<p class=\"page\">World War II made anime the tool for propaganda. Those animators and studios who didn\'t want to work in that direction were punished and ostracized. But because the society was militarized, anime with propaganda was lucrative during that time. 1945 saw release of full-length anime film Momotaro: Sacred Sailor. After the war Japan anime studios tried to adapt Western style while creating anime. Some of the studios of that time are known until these days. For example, Toie created The Tale of White Serpent in 1958.\r\n </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Osamu Tezuka</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The name of this cartoonist is associated with creating many famous anime that in the following decades set base for modern works. At first Osamu Tezuka work as manga artist, but later he was hired by Toi and animated Son-Goku the Monkey King. After emerging television Tezuka and Mushi Pro created the first anime series with title Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy). The series were about robot who helps to fight alien, criminal and other robots. Series were based on Tezuka\'s manga.\r\n	The work was so successful that it became famous abroad and NBC bought it to show in the USA. Astro Boy had at that time many main features the modern anime has now. For all his works Osamu Tezuka earned the title \"the father of manga\", \"the god of manga\".</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The 1980-th</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The 1980-th is the \"golden age\" of anime. Many anime studios were founded at that time. Anime established itself like distinctive part of Japan culture. Many people whose childhood was within Astro Boy\'s popularity had nostalgia for anime. The VHS gave another reason for popularizing anime.\r\n Our time</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Our time</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Since the beginning of 20-th Century many things have changed. World saw emerging of TV, computer, Internet. Creating anime became quicker and of more quality. The market is oversaturated now with different types of anime that are in free access (in most of cases).\r\n</p>|', '2017-01-10 09:25:18'),

Our life would be at least less comfortable without existing GPS. It allows navigating places we do not know, get information about where we are if we get lost occasionally. Still, there are plenty of cases where the Global Positioning System is used, and about which we do not know.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Segments of GPS</h3>|<p class=\"page\">It is always interesting to know what is inside the things. GPS is not just the satellites that move along their orbits. This system consists of three main parts: satellites that were mentioned before, controlling stations that placed on the lend and receivers that take signals and process them.</p>|<p class=\"page\">GPS has 24 satellites that constantly move along their orbits. The altitude at which they are located is about 20000 kilometers. The satellites were positioned at this altitude due to providing maximum covering of the land. At any time and in any place at least four satellites are available to user. Each satellite has atomic clock and transfers radio signals with constant interval and has its own code. GPS receiver can always determine from what satellite the signal was received. The controlling stations on the lend make corrections of satellite orbits and time on their atomic clocks. GPS receiver is any device that has a clock and can receive radio signals from satellites.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">How does it work?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">For positioning GPS receiver must have several data: position of each satellite (from at least four of them), time of receiving and transferring radio signals. Knowing these data allows GPS receiver to calculate location. Clocks on GPS receiver and satellites make possible to compute time of travelling radio signals from satellites to receivers. Receiver can calculate the distances to each satellite that is accessible at that moment by multiplying time on the light velocity. Using method called triangulation GPS receiver can narrow possible location to 1 - 15 meters.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Sources of GPS errors</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Even though GPS was designed to provide navigational accuracy of 10 to 15 meters, it sometimes fails to give precise location of the objects.  Discrepancies in satellites\' atomic clocks can impact the value of distance to satellite. Multipath interferences caused by objects that refract radio signals can make determining location less precise. Ionospheric interferences can make the signals to slow down or speed up. As a user of GPS receiver you can input incorrect date into it. Orbit errors happen because of gravitational pull and solar pressure fluctuation.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">GPS counterparts</h3>|<p class=\"page\">GPS is not the only such system. There are GLONASS (Russian system), Galileo (European Union project) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (China Positioning System). In the beginning, GLONASS was also intended to be just military project. But now it is also available to everyone who wants to use it. Galileo was created as European project only for civilian use.</p>|', '2017-01-14 09:15:14'),

Being in airport and seeing a whole rank of airplanes, you can involuntary think about the question of why the white color is picked up for airplanes.</p>', '<p class=\"page\">All is very simple. The main reason for such coating is the Sun. As we all know the white color is a reflector of sunlight, and this is very important for airplanes .\r\nAfter landing an airplane runs on low thrust, and it is difficult to ventilate all its parts. So it is no wonder that the body of an airplane is heated up very quickly to high temperature. Only conditioners can change this situation. This is particularly important for the countries that have hot climate. From some sources the white paint is more expensive than black one, from the others it is chipper. Though it is worth mentioning that metal, which has lighter color is more able to become smeary after some time.\r\nBut there are exceptions. Some airlines propose to fly on airplanes that have different colors, for example, green or yellow. Usually, this just for advertising.\r\nBy the way, military airplane is painted in khaki color. The reason for that is a disguise.</p>|', '2017-01-17 11:08:37'),

Servers are powerful, reliable computers that work twenty four hours per day and seven days per week. They are always connected to the Internet, and able to store and send data by request from the other computers, responding in that way on tens and hundreds of requests simultaneously. Clients are personal computers of users in the Internet, on which the request can be composed and sent, data can be received and shown. Often, these computers are not connected to the Internet permanently but connect it by need.\r\n</p>', '<h1 class=\"page\">How the Internet works</h1>', '../images/121232.jpg', '<p class=\"page\">All computers in the Interned can be divided on two big groups:  servers and clients.

Clients are personal computers of users in the Internet, on which the request can be composed and sent, data can be received and shown. Often, these computers are not connected to the Internet permanently but connect it by need.</p>', '<p class=\"page\">For connecting the Internet we address to the service of special companies, which have the name Provider of Internet services. Internet Provider is a company that provides access to the Internet through its servers. User computers connect to server by phone lines, channel or wirelessly. In its turn, servers are connected to the Internet by high-speed lines. User computers have appropriate soft, for example, browsers, which compose and send request to a server, then receive and show information on the computer monitor. Server, on its turn, has its own soft that stores information and respond to the requests of client soft.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Let\'s imagine that different users have different computers, on which different operation systems are set (Windows, Vista etc.) with different browsers (Opera, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). Different servers also have different soft. For correct work of programs that were written by different authors with different operation systems Protocols are needed. It is fair to say that Protocols help computer data exchanging. Every Internet service has its own protocol. For example, if you want to send e-mail, your computer must have program and a server must have soft that is appropriate to your program. Appropriate protocol must provide interaction of user\'s program with server. Thereby, for using any Internet services we need:</p>|<ul><li>-computer;\r\n</li><li>-user\'s program that is set on computer and able to work with a service protocol;\r\n</li><li>-server address which has appropriate soft</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">For simplification all aforementioned information let\'s suppose that one person from France want to have conversation with Bill from the USA. For providing communication you have to be sure that two of them know the same language (for example, English). But knowing just basic of the language is not enough. They must be able to organize all words in correct way, according to the rules. Only in that case Bill can understand a person from France. Computers use similar concept when they must find appropriate address. Each computer in the Internet has its unique IP address that has four number sequences from 0 to 255. It is possible to find a computer in any part of the World by using IP. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">If websites, blogs, etc. are part of World Wide Web, then where are they located? How can computer get there? Usually websites are stored on servers, so the servers have extensive disc space, required soft, and ability to respond on tens and hundreds requests simultaneously. For hosting a website in the Internet you need a Provider. Host Provider is a company that provides hosting service,  gives disc space on server for storing websites in the Internet. Remember, that hosting is not a process of website publication but lending of disc space. For finding any website on WWW you need to know IP address of a server, on which a website is stored. There are no problems for computer to remember  IP addresses in the form of number sequences. For people it is more difficult. Domain Name System brings more simplicity to make that work done. This is an alternative address system that understandable for people because computers are assigned not only IP address but also symbolic domain name. Domain name is symbol sequence that divided by period. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Although domain names are very handy for people, computers use number addresses. So for providing interaction between human and machine DNS server service was created. DNS server is a program that performs converting domain name into IP address and opposite. Very likely, you can compare DNS server with the address book on your mobile. We physically cannot remember all numbers that we need. So we write every number on the address book using unique name. For calling we find the name we need and a phone calculate what number must be called. The same method is used on DNS server.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">How can required data be found and transferred? World Wide Web has million different documents that are stored on servers and the task is finding and reading required document. For this, our browser must know exact location of document. All users well know that address consists of short name beginning with disc name and ending with directory names which divided by slash \"/\". So we definitely identify file on computer.\r\nEach file in the Internet also has its unique address. It has a name URL. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is universal resource locator or address of any file on the Internet. Except address of computer URL contains directive about which protocol must be used for requesting a file and what program to use on a server. Commonly, URL address made up of three principal elements: Protocol, Domain name, file path. Let\'s analyze in detail the following URL  http://videofun.com/dns/service/dns-serv.html:\r\n</p>|<ul><li>-http is a protocol. It defines the rules for the interaction between client and server. Protocol has a name HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP;\r\n</li><li>-A domain name of a server follows after that. In our case this is videofun.com., where .com is high level domain;</li>\r\n</li><li>-dns/service/dns-serv.html is a path to our file, which is in directory dns-serv.html.</li></ul>|', '2017-01-20 08:57:21'),

Depression is an abnormal emotional state, which impacts our thinking, emotions, our perception and behavior in different situations. When we are in depression, we are sad about all. A depression is not always triggered by difficult events or situation, changed circumstances. In fact, depression rises when there is no visible reason for it. The life seems to be normal, but you feel yourself awful. Depression erases all colors from your life, makes all less interesting and enjoyable. Depression undermines your energy, motivation and ability to experience joy, pleasure, excitement, satisfaction, affection and love. When you are in depression you become inpatient, loose control of yourself, get angry or upset more quickly and you need more time for getting over all that. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Symptoms of depression</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Professionals consider anyone possessing at least 5 from the following symptoms during continuous period of time as clinically depressed.

You should remember that human being can make errors, be careless and as a result text in the Word can have bad appearance. To see all errors you can type Ctrl+*. This combination of keys makes the program to show all non-printed symbols that usually are hidden from view. Formatting is another common reason of why you have some additional spaces. You can fix this by going to the text setting. If you look at the ribbon on the home tab, you can spot icons with small line placed close to each other on the paragraph group. There are four of them. You can choose the alignment style by typing one of the icons. You can play with them to understand their functions. Actually, it is not very difficult, and makes you feel more accustomed to text alignment in the Word. You can choose to justify a text on a page. In that case, text will be aligned along the left and right margins. So in some cases the spaces between the words can be large, and  text can look slightly strange. For fixing this you can select the paragraph that you want to change and choose left alignment. Another reason for big spacing is typing tab key. You can accidently type the tab key. In that case, you have bigger spacing. Type the combination Ctrl+* for spotting all hidden symbols. In that way, you can understand where on the text you have bigger spacing and what the reason for this. Find and delete the tab characters that look like arrow. \r\n</p>|', '2017-01-30 08:41:05'),

Each application that was downloaded from the Internet can be restored.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What are the options for backing up PC?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can backup the files using two methods: onsite and offsite. First one is using external drive for backup. It is fast and easy. But in the case of fire or robbery you can loose all your data. Offsite backup is when your files are stored in different places, for example, on server. For this backup you can use special services. One example of such service is Crash Plan. Also, you can store your data on external drive and pass it to your friend or put it in bank safe. It will be offsite backup. Finally, you can use cloud service for backing up your files. Each method has its pro and cons. </p>|<p class=\"page\">Backing up files using external drive is the fastest and easiest way. You can use for this any hard drive that is big enough to store all your important file several times. For backup you can use built-in Windows\' utility but it provides you with bare minimum. To do it better use special software that allows to perform full, incremental and differential backup. Each backup has differences. Full backup saves every piece of information, including folders, files, and applications. Differential backups save the files that were changed since the last backup. Good backup applications are Genie Backup Manager, Acronis Backup for PC, Nova BACKUP.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Using online backup service is good option, but it will cost you at least 5$ per month. But if you buy any, you\'ll be provided with all software and automatic backing your files.</p>|<p class=\"page\">To save your money, you can use cloud services like Google Drive, MicrosoftOneDrive, Dropbox. But in that case you can only save your file on the server. These services is not for backup and you  can not have automatic backup, and programs that will be running in background and create point of restoring. Also you have not enough (in the case of using service for free) space for saving all you want.</p>|', '2017-02-05 08:23:42'),

Obviously, the language had a lack of words and phrases, so the writers of that time were forced to invent them or borrow from other languages. In that situation, Shakespeare tryed to create the greatest of his works. Not only he succeded in that, but did also immensly expanded the scope of English literature. He used different ways for inventing new words and phrases, but the result was always stunning. Sounding from the monologs of colorful characters the words became those words and quotes that we use in our day. Shakespeare\'s significance in the time of great transforming of English was in enriching the language, extending its vocabulary and creating new words and phrases. In time when language was not standardized and had not formed in the way we used to see it now, Shakespeare\'s works had significant impact.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Shakespeare\'s legacy in modern English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Have you ever wonder how many words and phrases that were created by Shakespeare you use in daily life? Unwittingly you can use some of his words or even phrases from his plays. It is amazing how many his quotes are used even in our day. Without some of them our English would be less vivid and diverse. For example, we hardly would describe the scenes of serial killer without the word \"cold-blooded\" and your show about vampires would be less deep. The week could not be eventful without Shakespeare creativity and your wedding is just a stage of your life, but not auspicious occasion on which you wait. Have you ever used the words \"fashionable\" in the collocations like \"a fashionable dress\", \"a fashionable hotel\", \"a fashionable cafe\", \"a fashionable style\"? All these collocations would not be possible without word \"fashionable\" or at least would sound strange. Firstly the word \"fashionable\" emerged in Shakespeare\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\".\r\nThere are many other examples:</p>|<ul><li>-be \"in a pickle\" - means be in trouble;\r\n</li><li>-\"to much of good things\" - means that \"to much of good things\" is not always good for you;\r\n</li><li>\"clothes make the man\" - means that clothes impact the way people will see you as a person;\r\n</li><li>-\"break the ice\" - beginning of conversation with someone who you see the first time;\r\n</li><li>-\"fair play\" - means play while following all rules (in the sport)</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be continued. As you can see from words and phrases, they are used pretty frequently in our daily life, not mention about quotes that are used also very often. </p>|', '2017-02-10 08:18:36'),

It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the duplicate files?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Duplicate files are the files that are copies of other files. Format of files can be different: text, music, picture, etc. Sizes of duplicates can vary.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Why does it happen?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Not only you chip in creating duplicate files on your computer, but Windows also makes identical copies of the same files. It makes operating system more stable and reliable while malware may change some critical files. Some malware can change system files and make your Windows unbootable. For this does not happen Windows has System File Protection. Its main goal is to prevent these changes from harming of operating system and making it unbootable in the end. System File Protection always has a back up of system files, that is, actually, identical copy of files. When some system files are deleted, System File Protection restores the original copies of these files. Many programs also might give duplicate files while installing or updating. It happens because program wants to make itself more reliable by creating its library. For example, some part of library of one program might be identical to the library of another program. But each program wants to install its own version of library, because changes in library (in the case of using the same part of library by two or more programs) might harm another program. It results in creating duplicate files. While updating, apps can also create new versions with  duplicate files. All this changes happen without our knowing and acting. But we also can create duplicate files. We can download the same file twice or copy the same file into different folders, drives.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the solution?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can find duplicate files manually and delete them. But such work is hardly productive and takes your precious time. Also, you cannot quickly distinguish between the files that are similar. But they  might be the copies of the same file, taking free space from your computer. Better solution is using special programs that can find and delete duplicate files. </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the best app to solve the problem?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The app that can find and delete duplicate files must have the following features:</p>|<ul><li>-be free to use or at least have free version that you can use;\r\n</li><li>-be without additional programs like installing toolbar or changing your search engine on browser;\r\n</li><li>-be easy to use;\r\n</li><li>-be free from malware</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">It is obvious there are plenty of different programs out there that you can use for solution to the problem with duplicate files. But you cannot use many of them because they are paid apps or have additional programs. \r\nOne of the programs that you can use for this purpose is dupeGuru. It is free to use and does not install junkware on your computer. It is easy to use and you can quickly understand what to do from beginning. To start your scanning you must add a few folders, and click scan. dupeGuru has dupe Guru Music Edition and dupe Guru Pictures Edition. As their names suggest, each one has its own purpose. You\'ll be much more comfortable when searching duplicate image files by using dupe Guru Pictures Edition. When you want to search for duplicate music files, it is better to use Music Edition.</p>|', '2017-02-22 07:59:38'),

Usual aspect of every modern city like skyscrapers can hardly be seen in Washington, DC. But you can see from almost every place of the city that it consists of squat structures. They are wide but not tall. It becomes more stunning when you think that this is the capital of country which is famous for putting man on the Moon and creating the Internet. To be honest, except one applied for skyscraper, all other modern technologies were used for creating buildings in Washington, DC. As a result, the residents have underground garages and modern offices, but all this is packed in low-height buildings.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">The cause of Washington\'s particular architecture</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The reason the Washington has not tall structures like many other American cities is the Height of Buildings Act that was enacted by Congress in 1910. Actually, before that document there was another version of this paper in 1889. Both of them were created as response to building of Cairo hotel, which had 14 stories. The latest version of act (1910) is valid until these days and restricts the height of any building to be higher than the width of adjacent street plus 20 feet up to a maximum of 90 feet on residential street, 130 feet on commercial street, and 160 feet on a small portion of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Two views on the problem</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Despite that restriction remains in force until these days and most of the buildings were created within the time of its validity, there have been many attempts to remove the Height of Buildings Act. There are many reasons for removing or at least relaxing this document.</p>|<p class=\"page\">In the terms of housing prices, hotel rooms Washington, DC can be at the top of list that represents the most expensive cities. This affects every part of life in the city making it affordable only for those who are related to politic sphere or business. Because of that, working class moves from the city to its neighbor environs. For the same reason tourism struggles to become profitable enough. Deleting any restrictions about height of the buildings would lower prices for hotel rooms and rent of offices allowing more people to move in the city. Having more residents could create more jobs in different areas and low prices for services.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Fans of opposite view have other thoughts about architecture of the city. Modern high buildings create the lists of unwanted inconveniences such as hindering of daylight on the streets, wind tunnels and making the skyline of the city uglier. The absence of skyscrapers in Washington for their view brings to the capital the ambience of Paris.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The future</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Talking about Washington, it\'s worth to mention other capitals like London or Berlin that despite being centers for political life became also business and culture hearts. It\'s obvious that city lacks high building that would make it more business oriented. Whit that, many people would have more opportunities while living in Washington.</p>|', '2017-02-27 07:43:09'),

Maybe, you have already used it for getting to place you needed. It is very helpful and convenient in these cases. But how does it work?</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Global Positioning System</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Global Positioning System or GPS is a network that consists of 30 satellites and broadcasts radio signals with interval. Everyone who has GPS receiver (for example, sell phone) and is located along the lines of sight to at least three satellites can use GPS for navigation or determination location. The more satellites are available for your receiver, the more precise would be data about your location. But once you enter a building, you can lose your contact with GPS. It happens because radio signals can be attenuated by the materials of the buildings like concrete and iron. The signal from GPS in this case will be scattered by the elements of the building: roof, walls, and ceiling.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Indoor solutions</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Because GPS does not work or does not provide required preciseness inside buildings, indoor solutions were invented. It was logically predictable, because at least 80% of their time human beings spend indoors, and Indoor Positioning Systems are in need for many spheres of business. At that time there is no standard technology that is used for such solutions. Different companies try to implement their own solution for this task. Very likely, for such solutions already existing technology will be used. Another important point is that for receiving precise data about location of individual or object more than one technology must be used. Many solutions use Wi-Fi access points for locating and navigating. But in that case data will be precise only if ideal conditions were created, because receiver must be placed on crossing of unobstructed straight lines to three access points. This is in the case a technology uses trilateration for determining location. Other technologies use Bluetooth Low Energy for determining location. For example, an Apple\'s positioning system uses Bluetooth Low Energy to contact transmitters and collect data about location of an object. This technology (iBeacon) requires additional hardware (transmitters) and qualified personals for setting it. No matter what type of technology is used in Indoor Positioning System, it needs precise map of building with determining all floors. In the case of using Wi-Fi access points it needs also precise specifying of those points on map.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Cases for using Indoor Positioning Systems</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Indoor Positioning Systems may be used in the following cases:</p>|<ul><li>-location of individuals or objects;\r</li><li>-navigation;\r</li><li>-helping people with impaired view;\r</li><li>-in emergency cases;\r</li><li>-for enhancing security of a building;\r</li><li>-for providing the customers with just-in-time information they need;\r</li><li>-for guiding customers to places they need;\r</li><li>-for gathering information</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be bigger and using Indoor Positioning Solutions might be beneficial in many other cases. Within some time these technologies have all chances to become as ubiquitous as GPS that was created like military project but became  an important part of our life.</p>|', '2017-03-01 11:02:47');

Back in 1917 Japan artists tried to create first anime. But they had little similarity with what we prefer to watch these days. Without sound, and many frames of animation it was created by drawing characters with chalk. Anime created at the beginning of 20-th Century was destroyed by the following Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and World War II. Most of works were created on cellulose, and as such had not good chances to be saved until this time.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">First steps</h3>|<p class=\"page\">World War II made anime the tool for propaganda. Those animators and studios who didn\'t want to work in that direction were punished and ostracized. But because the society was militarized, anime with propaganda was lucrative during that time. 1945 saw release of full-length anime film Momotaro: Sacred Sailor. After the war Japan anime studios tried to adapt Western style while creating anime. Some of the studios of that time are known until these days. For example, Toie created The Tale of White Serpent in 1958.\r\n </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Osamu Tezuka</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The name of this cartoonist is associated with creating many famous anime that in the following decades set base for modern works. At first Osamu Tezuka work as manga artist, but later he was hired by Toi and animated Son-Goku the Monkey King. After emerging television Tezuka and Mushi Pro created the first anime series with title Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy). The series were about robot who helps to fight alien, criminal and other robots. Series were based on Tezuka\'s manga.\r\n	The work was so successful that it became famous abroad and NBC bought it to show in the USA. Astro Boy had at that time many main features the modern anime has now. For all his works Osamu Tezuka earned the title \"the father of manga\", \"the god of manga\".</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The 1980-th</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The 1980-th is the \"golden age\" of anime. Many anime studios were founded at that time. Anime established itself like distinctive part of Japan culture. Many people whose childhood was within Astro Boy\'s popularity had nostalgia for anime. The VHS gave another reason for popularizing anime.\r\n Our time</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Our time</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Since the beginning of 20-th Century many things have changed. World saw emerging of TV, computer, Internet. Creating anime became quicker and of more quality.

GPS is not just the satellites that move along their orbits. This system consists of three main parts: satellites that were mentioned before, controlling stations that placed on the lend and receivers that take signals and process them.</p>|<p class=\"page\">GPS has 24 satellites that constantly move along their orbits. The altitude at which they are located is about 20000 kilometers. The satellites were positioned at this altitude due to providing maximum covering of the land. At any time and in any place at least four satellites are available to user. Each satellite has atomic clock and transfers radio signals with constant interval and has its own code. GPS receiver can always determine from what satellite the signal was received. The controlling stations on the lend make corrections of satellite orbits and time on their atomic clocks. GPS receiver is any device that has a clock and can receive radio signals from satellites.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">How does it work?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">For positioning GPS receiver must have several data: position of each satellite (from at least four of them), time of receiving and transferring radio signals. Knowing these data allows GPS receiver to calculate location. Clocks on GPS receiver and satellites make possible to compute time of travelling radio signals from satellites to receivers. Receiver can calculate the distances to each satellite that is accessible at that moment by multiplying time on the light velocity. Using method called triangulation GPS receiver can narrow possible location to 1 - 15 meters.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Sources of GPS errors</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Even though GPS was designed to provide navigational accuracy of 10 to 15 meters, it sometimes fails to give precise location of the objects.  Discrepancies in satellites\' atomic clocks can impact the value of distance to satellite. Multipath interferences caused by objects that refract radio signals can make determining location less precise. Ionospheric interferences can make the signals to slow down or speed up. As a user of GPS receiver you can input incorrect date into it. Orbit errors happen because of gravitational pull and solar pressure fluctuation.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">GPS counterparts</h3>|<p class=\"page\">GPS is not the only such system. There are GLONASS (Russian system), Galileo (European Union project) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (China Positioning System). In the beginning, GLONASS was also intended to be just military project. But now it is also available to everyone who wants to use it. Galileo was created as European project only for civilian use.</p>|', '2017-01-14 09:15:14'),

So it is no wonder that the body of an airplane is heated up very quickly to high temperature. Only conditioners can change this situation. This is particularly important for the countries that have hot climate. From some sources the white paint is more expensive than black one, from the others it is chipper. Though it is worth mentioning that metal, which has lighter color is more able to become smeary after some time.\r\nBut there are exceptions.

Internet Provider is a company that provides access to the Internet through its servers. User computers connect to server by phone lines, channel or wirelessly. In its turn, servers are connected to the Internet by high-speed lines. User computers have appropriate soft, for example, browsers, which compose and send request to a server, then receive and show information on the computer monitor. Server, on its turn, has its own soft that stores information and respond to the requests of client soft.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Let\'s imagine that different users have different computers, on which different operation systems are set (Windows, Vista etc.) with different browsers (Opera, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). Different servers also have different soft. For correct work of programs that were written by different authors with different operation systems Protocols are needed. It is fair to say that Protocols help computer data exchanging. Every Internet service has its own protocol. For example, if you want to send e-mail, your computer must have program and a server must have soft that is appropriate to your program. Appropriate protocol must provide interaction of user\'s program with server. Thereby, for using any Internet services we need:</p>|<ul><li>-computer;\r\n</li><li>-user\'s program that is set on computer and able to work with a service protocol;\r\n</li><li>-server address which has appropriate soft</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">For simplification all aforementioned information let\'s suppose that one person from France want to have conversation with Bill from the USA. For providing communication you have to be sure that two of them know the same language (for example, English). But knowing just basic of the language is not enough. They must be able to organize all words in correct way, according to the rules. Only in that case Bill can understand a person from France. Computers use similar concept when they must find appropriate address. Each computer in the Internet has its unique IP address that has four number sequences from 0 to 255. It is possible to find a computer in any part of the World by using IP. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">If websites, blogs, etc. are part of World Wide Web, then where are they located? How can computer get there? Usually websites are stored on servers, so the servers have extensive disc space, required soft, and ability to respond on tens and hundreds requests simultaneously. For hosting a website in the Internet you need a Provider. Host Provider is a company that provides hosting service,  gives disc space on server for storing websites in the Internet. Remember, that hosting is not a process of website publication but lending of disc space. For finding any website on WWW you need to know IP address of a server, on which a website is stored. There are no problems for computer to remember  IP addresses in the form of number sequences. For people it is more difficult. Domain Name System brings more simplicity to make that work done. This is an alternative address system that understandable for people because computers are assigned not only IP address but also symbolic domain name. Domain name is symbol sequence that divided by period. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Although domain names are very handy for people, computers use number addresses. So for providing interaction between human and machine DNS server service was created. DNS server is a program that performs converting domain name into IP address and opposite. Very likely, you can compare DNS server with the address book on your mobile. We physically cannot remember all numbers that we need. So we write every number on the address book using unique name. For calling we find the name we need and a phone calculate what number must be called. The same method is used on DNS server.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">How can required data be found and transferred? World Wide Web has million different documents that are stored on servers and the task is finding and reading required document. For this, our browser must know exact location of document. All users well know that address consists of short name beginning with disc name and ending with directory names which divided by slash \"/\". So we definitely identify file on computer.\r\nEach file in the Internet also has its unique address. It has a name URL. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is universal resource locator or address of any file on the Internet. Except address of computer URL contains directive about which protocol must be used for requesting a file and what program to use on a server. Commonly, URL address made up of three principal elements: Protocol, Domain name, file path. Let\'s analyze in detail the following URL  http://videofun.com/dns/service/dns-serv.html:\r\n</p>|<ul><li>-http is a protocol. It defines the rules for the interaction between client and server. Protocol has a name HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP;\r\n</li><li>-A domain name of a server follows after that. In our case this is videofun.com., where .com is high level domain;</li>\r\n</li><li>-dns/service/dns-serv.html is a path to our file, which is in directory dns-serv.html.</li></ul>|', '2017-01-20 08:57:21'),

And this is a big issue. The widespread ignorance of people in this case can lead to neglecting serious psychological disorder, which must be treated. Sadness is a normal human emotion that we all experience in our life on and on.  Usually, sadness is caused by difficulties, complex events or disappointment.  In another words, we are sad about something particular. This is also means that when situation changes and the reason for our emotional pain disappears or we fix the situation or put up with it, a sadness fades away. Depression is an abnormal emotional state, which impacts our thinking, emotions, our perception and behavior in different situations. When we are in depression, we are sad about all. A depression is not always triggered by difficult events or situation, changed circumstances. In fact, depression rises when there is no visible reason for it. The life seems to be normal, but you feel yourself awful. Depression erases all colors from your life, makes all less interesting and enjoyable. Depression undermines your energy, motivation and ability to experience joy, pleasure, excitement, satisfaction, affection and love. When you are in depression you become inpatient, loose control of yourself, get angry or upset more quickly and you need more time for getting over all that. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Symptoms of depression</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Professionals consider anyone possessing at least 5 from the following symptoms during continuous period of time as clinically depressed.

You should remember that human being can make errors, be careless and as a result text in the Word can have bad appearance. To see all errors you can type Ctrl+*. This combination of keys makes the program to show all non-printed symbols that usually are hidden from view. Formatting is another common reason of why you have some additional spaces. You can fix this by going to the text setting. If you look at the ribbon on the home tab, you can spot icons with small line placed close to each other on the paragraph group. There are four of them. You can choose the alignment style by typing one of the icons. You can play with them to understand their functions. Actually, it is not very difficult, and makes you feel more accustomed to text alignment in the Word. You can choose to justify a text on a page. In that case, text will be aligned along the left and right margins. So in some cases the spaces between the words can be large, and  text can look slightly strange. For fixing this you can select the paragraph that you want to change and choose left alignment. Another reason for big spacing is typing tab key. You can accidently type the tab key. In that case, you have bigger spacing. Type the combination Ctrl+* for spotting all hidden symbols. In that way, you can understand where on the text you have bigger spacing and what the reason for this. Find and delete the tab characters that look like arrow. \r\n</p>|', '2017-01-30 08:41:05'),

You can lose your personal files as a result of activity these malicious programs or crash of your hard drive. Even though some people think that this is something that can not happen with them, this is very real. And if you visualize this, you can see that this can be a disaster. To prevent this from happening or (it\'s right to say) to minimize the consequences of loosing your data, you can make backup of the files you think are important for you.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the files  worth backing up?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">When backing up your computer, you might consider the option of storing not all information from your PC. Actually, you must backup only the files that cannot be restored. It can be only your personal files, because other information can be restored from the Internet. But you hardly will be able to restore your photos from travel last year or video from party which was just in one copy on your PC. Each application that was downloaded from the Internet can be restored.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What are the options for backing up PC?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can backup the files using two methods: onsite and offsite. First one is using external drive for backup. It is fast and easy. But in the case of fire or robbery you can loose all your data. Offsite backup is when your files are stored in different places, for example, on server. For this backup you can use special services. One example of such service is Crash Plan. Also, you can store your data on external drive and pass it to your friend or put it in bank safe. It will be offsite backup. Finally, you can use cloud service for backing up your files. Each method has its pro and cons. </p>|<p class=\"page\">Backing up files using external drive is the fastest and easiest way. You can use for this any hard drive that is big enough to store all your important file several times. For backup you can use built-in Windows\' utility but it provides you with bare minimum. To do it better use special software that allows to perform full, incremental and differential backup. Each backup has differences. Full backup saves every piece of information, including folders, files, and applications. Differential backups save the files that were changed since the last backup. Good backup applications are Genie Backup Manager, Acronis Backup for PC, Nova BACKUP.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Using online backup service is good option, but it will cost you at least 5$ per month. But if you buy any, you\'ll be provided with all software and automatic backing your files.</p>|<p class=\"page\">To save your money, you can use cloud services like Google Drive, MicrosoftOneDrive, Dropbox. But in that case you can only save your file on the server. These services is not for backup and you  can not have automatic backup, and programs that will be running in background and create point of restoring. Also you have not enough (in the case of using service for free) space for saving all you want.</p>|', '2017-02-05 08:23:42'),

His influence extends far beyond just his plays. His legacy impacted English literature and theatre. The characters of his plays were unforgettable and their monologs brought to the public plenty of famous quotes, which we can use nowadays even without knowing their origin. Just imagine: this man lived four cunturies ago, but his words and phrases are used in our speech. There is no doubts, English would be different without Shakespeare\'s \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Macbeth\" or \"Hamlet\". And for sure, we would not be able to express our thoughts in such a vivid way that we do using modern English. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Standardization of English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Shakespeare lived in the time when language was not standardized. It meant that there were not established grammar, vocabulary and spelling. Obviously, the language had a lack of words and phrases, so the writers of that time were forced to invent them or borrow from other languages. In that situation, Shakespeare tryed to create the greatest of his works. Not only he succeded in that, but did also immensly expanded the scope of English literature. He used different ways for inventing new words and phrases, but the result was always stunning. Sounding from the monologs of colorful characters the words became those words and quotes that we use in our day. Shakespeare\'s significance in the time of great transforming of English was in enriching the language, extending its vocabulary and creating new words and phrases. In time when language was not standardized and had not formed in the way we used to see it now, Shakespeare\'s works had significant impact.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Shakespeare\'s legacy in modern English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Have you ever wonder how many words and phrases that were created by Shakespeare you use in daily life? Unwittingly you can use some of his words or even phrases from his plays. It is amazing how many his quotes are used even in our day. Without some of them our English would be less vivid and diverse. For example, we hardly would describe the scenes of serial killer without the word \"cold-blooded\" and your show about vampires would be less deep. The week could not be eventful without Shakespeare creativity and your wedding is just a stage of your life, but not auspicious occasion on which you wait. Have you ever used the words \"fashionable\" in the collocations like \"a fashionable dress\", \"a fashionable hotel\", \"a fashionable cafe\", \"a fashionable style\"? All these collocations would not be possible without word \"fashionable\" or at least would sound strange. Firstly the word \"fashionable\" emerged in Shakespeare\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\".\r\nThere are many other examples:</p>|<ul><li>-be \"in a pickle\" - means be in trouble;\r\n</li><li>-\"to much of good things\" - means that \"to much of good things\" is not always good for you;\r\n</li><li>\"clothes make the man\" - means that clothes impact the way people will see you as a person;\r\n</li><li>-\"break the ice\" - beginning of conversation with someone who you see the first time;\r\n</li><li>-\"fair play\" - means play while following all rules (in the sport)</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be continued.

It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the duplicate files?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Duplicate files are the files that are copies of other files. Format of files can be different: text, music, picture, etc. Sizes of duplicates can vary.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Why does it happen?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Not only you chip in creating duplicate files on your computer, but Windows also makes identical copies of the same files. It makes operating system more stable and reliable while malware may change some critical files. Some malware can change system files and make your Windows unbootable. For this does not happen Windows has System File Protection. Its main goal is to prevent these changes from harming of operating system and making it unbootable in the end. System File Protection always has a back up of system files, that is, actually, identical copy of files. When some system files are deleted, System File Protection restores the original copies of these files. Many programs also might give duplicate files while installing or updating. It happens because program wants to make itself more reliable by creating its library. For example, some part of library of one program might be identical to the library of another program. But each program wants to install its own version of library, because changes in library (in the case of using the same part of library by two or more programs) might harm another program. It results in creating duplicate files. While updating, apps can also create new versions with  duplicate files. All this changes happen without our knowing and acting. But we also can create duplicate files. We can download the same file twice or copy the same file into different folders, drives.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the solution?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can find duplicate files manually and delete them. But such work is hardly productive and takes your precious time. Also, you cannot quickly distinguish between the files that are similar. But they  might be the copies of the same file, taking free space from your computer. Better solution is using special programs that can find and delete duplicate files. </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the best app to solve the problem?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The app that can find and delete duplicate files must have the following features:</p>|<ul><li>-be free to use or at least have free version that you can use;\r\n</li><li>-be without additional programs like installing toolbar or changing your search engine on browser;\r\n</li><li>-be easy to use;\r\n</li><li>-be free from malware</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">It is obvious there are plenty of different programs out there that you can use for solution to the problem with duplicate files. But you cannot use many of them because they are paid apps or have additional programs. \r\nOne of the programs that you can use for this purpose is dupeGuru. It is free to use and does not install junkware on your computer. It is easy to use and you can quickly understand what to do from beginning. To start your scanning you must add a few folders, and click scan. dupeGuru has dupe Guru Music Edition and dupe Guru Pictures Edition. As their names suggest, each one has its own purpose. You\'ll be much more comfortable when searching duplicate image files by using dupe Guru Pictures Edition.

To be honest, except one applied for skyscraper, all other modern technologies were used for creating buildings in Washington, DC. As a result, the residents have underground garages and modern offices, but all this is packed in low-height buildings.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">The cause of Washington\'s particular architecture</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The reason the Washington has not tall structures like many other American cities is the Height of Buildings Act that was enacted by Congress in 1910. Actually, before that document there was another version of this paper in 1889. Both of them were created as response to building of Cairo hotel, which had 14 stories. The latest version of act (1910) is valid until these days and restricts the height of any building to be higher than the width of adjacent street plus 20 feet up to a maximum of 90 feet on residential street, 130 feet on commercial street, and 160 feet on a small portion of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Two views on the problem</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Despite that restriction remains in force until these days and most of the buildings were created within the time of its validity, there have been many attempts to remove the Height of Buildings Act. There are many reasons for removing or at least relaxing this document.</p>|<p class=\"page\">In the terms of housing prices, hotel rooms Washington, DC can be at the top of list that represents the most expensive cities. This affects every part of life in the city making it affordable only for those who are related to politic sphere or business. Because of that, working class moves from the city to its neighbor environs. For the same reason tourism struggles to become profitable enough. Deleting any restrictions about height of the buildings would lower prices for hotel rooms and rent of offices allowing more people to move in the city. Having more residents could create more jobs in different areas and low prices for services.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Fans of opposite view have other thoughts about architecture of the city. Modern high buildings create the lists of unwanted inconveniences such as hindering of daylight on the streets, wind tunnels and making the skyline of the city uglier. The absence of skyscrapers in Washington for their view brings to the capital the ambience of Paris.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The future</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Talking about Washington, it\'s worth to mention other capitals like London or Berlin that despite being centers for political life became also business and culture hearts. It\'s obvious that city lacks high building that would make it more business oriented. Whit that, many people would have more opportunities while living in Washington.</p>|', '2017-02-27 07:43:09'),

Everyone who has GPS receiver (for example, sell phone) and is located along the lines of sight to at least three satellites can use GPS for navigation or determination location. The more satellites are available for your receiver, the more precise would be data about your location. But once you enter a building, you can lose your contact with GPS. It happens because radio signals can be attenuated by the materials of the buildings like concrete and iron. The signal from GPS in this case will be scattered by the elements of the building: roof, walls, and ceiling.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Indoor solutions</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Because GPS does not work or does not provide required preciseness inside buildings, indoor solutions were invented. It was logically predictable, because at least 80% of their time human beings spend indoors, and Indoor Positioning Systems are in need for many spheres of business. At that time there is no standard technology that is used for such solutions. Different companies try to implement their own solution for this task. Very likely, for such solutions already existing technology will be used. Another important point is that for receiving precise data about location of individual or object more than one technology must be used. Many solutions use Wi-Fi access points for locating and navigating. But in that case data will be precise only if ideal conditions were created, because receiver must be placed on crossing of unobstructed straight lines to three access points. This is in the case a technology uses trilateration for determining location. Other technologies use Bluetooth Low Energy for determining location. For example, an Apple\'s positioning system uses Bluetooth Low Energy to contact transmitters and collect data about location of an object. This technology (iBeacon) requires additional hardware (transmitters) and qualified personals for setting it. No matter what type of technology is used in Indoor Positioning System, it needs precise map of building with determining all floors. In the case of using Wi-Fi access points it needs also precise specifying of those points on map.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Cases for using Indoor Positioning Systems</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Indoor Positioning Systems may be used in the following cases:</p>|<ul><li>-location of individuals or objects;\r</li><li>-navigation;\r</li><li>-helping people with impaired view;\r</li><li>-in emergency cases;\r</li><li>-for enhancing security of a building;\r</li><li>-for providing the customers with just-in-time information they need;\r</li><li>-for guiding customers to places they need;\r</li><li>-for gathering information</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be bigger and using Indoor Positioning Solutions might be beneficial in many other cases. Within some time these technologies have all chances to become as ubiquitous as GPS that was created like military project but became  an important part of our life.</p>|', '2017-03-01 11:02:47');

There are also exaggerations in their physical features: big eyes, larger and brighter face. Children and adult like to watch anime, and because of bigger audience it has millions of fans across the globe.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Origin</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Japan is considered to be homeland of anime. Back in 1917 Japan artists tried to create first anime. But they had little similarity with what we prefer to watch these days. Without sound, and many frames of animation it was created by drawing characters with chalk. Anime created at the beginning of 20-th Century was destroyed by the following Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and World War II. Most of works were created on cellulose, and as such had not good chances to be saved until this time.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">First steps</h3>|<p class=\"page\">World War II made anime the tool for propaganda. Those animators and studios who didn\'t want to work in that direction were punished and ostracized. But because the society was militarized, anime with propaganda was lucrative during that time. 1945 saw release of full-length anime film Momotaro: Sacred Sailor. After the war Japan anime studios tried to adapt Western style while creating anime. Some of the studios of that time are known until these days. For example, Toie created The Tale of White Serpent in 1958.\r\n </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Osamu Tezuka</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The name of this cartoonist is associated with creating many famous anime that in the following decades set base for modern works. At first Osamu Tezuka work as manga artist, but later he was hired by Toi and animated Son-Goku the Monkey King. After emerging television Tezuka and Mushi Pro created the first anime series with title Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy). The series were about robot who helps to fight alien, criminal and other robots. Series were based on Tezuka\'s manga.\r\n	The work was so successful that it became famous abroad and NBC bought it to show in the USA. Astro Boy had at that time many main features the modern anime has now. For all his works Osamu Tezuka earned the title \"the father of manga\", \"the god of manga\".</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The 1980-th</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The 1980-th is the \"golden age\" of anime. Many anime studios were founded at that time. Anime established itself like distinctive part of Japan culture. Many people whose childhood was within Astro Boy\'s popularity had nostalgia for anime. The VHS gave another reason for popularizing anime.\r\n Our time</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Our time</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Since the beginning of 20-th Century many things have changed. World saw emerging of TV, computer, Internet. Creating anime became quicker and of more quality. The market is oversaturated now with different types of anime that are in free access (in most of cases).\r\n</p>|', '2017-01-10 09:25:18'),

Our life would be at least less comfortable without existing GPS. It allows navigating places we do not know, get information about where we are if we get lost occasionally. Still, there are plenty of cases where the Global Positioning System is used, and about which we do not know.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Segments of GPS</h3>|<p class=\"page\">It is always interesting to know what is inside the things. GPS is not just the satellites that move along their orbits. This system consists of three main parts: satellites that were mentioned before, controlling stations that placed on the lend and receivers that take signals and process them.</p>|<p class=\"page\">GPS has 24 satellites that constantly move along their orbits. The altitude at which they are located is about 20000 kilometers. The satellites were positioned at this altitude due to providing maximum covering of the land. At any time and in any place at least four satellites are available to user. Each satellite has atomic clock and transfers radio signals with constant interval and has its own code. GPS receiver can always determine from what satellite the signal was received. The controlling stations on the lend make corrections of satellite orbits and time on their atomic clocks. GPS receiver is any device that has a clock and can receive radio signals from satellites.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">How does it work?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">For positioning GPS receiver must have several data: position of each satellite (from at least four of them), time of receiving and transferring radio signals. Knowing these data allows GPS receiver to calculate location. Clocks on GPS receiver and satellites make possible to compute time of travelling radio signals from satellites to receivers. Receiver can calculate the distances to each satellite that is accessible at that moment by multiplying time on the light velocity. Using method called triangulation GPS receiver can narrow possible location to 1 - 15 meters.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Sources of GPS errors</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Even though GPS was designed to provide navigational accuracy of 10 to 15 meters, it sometimes fails to give precise location of the objects.  Discrepancies in satellites\' atomic clocks can impact the value of distance to satellite. Multipath interferences caused by objects that refract radio signals can make determining location less precise. Ionospheric interferences can make the signals to slow down or speed up. As a user of GPS receiver you can input incorrect date into it. Orbit errors happen because of gravitational pull and solar pressure fluctuation.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">GPS counterparts</h3>|<p class=\"page\">GPS is not the only such system. There are GLONASS (Russian system), Galileo (European Union project) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (China Positioning System). In the beginning, GLONASS was also intended to be just military project. But now it is also available to everyone who wants to use it. Galileo was created as European project only for civilian use.</p>|', '2017-01-14 09:15:14'),

Being in airport and seeing a whole rank of airplanes, you can involuntary think about the question of why the white color is picked up for airplanes.</p>', '<p class=\"page\">All is very simple. The main reason for such coating is the Sun. As we all know the white color is a reflector of sunlight, and this is very important for airplanes .\r\nAfter landing an airplane runs on low thrust, and it is difficult to ventilate all its parts. So it is no wonder that the body of an airplane is heated up very quickly to high temperature. Only conditioners can change this situation. This is particularly important for the countries that have hot climate. From some sources the white paint is more expensive than black one, from the others it is chipper. Though it is worth mentioning that metal, which has lighter color is more able to become smeary after some time.\r\nBut there are exceptions. Some airlines propose to fly on airplanes that have different colors, for example, green or yellow. Usually, this just for advertising.\r\nBy the way, military airplane is painted in khaki color. The reason for that is a disguise.</p>|', '2017-01-17 11:08:37'),

Servers are powerful, reliable computers that work twenty four hours per day and seven days per week. They are always connected to the Internet, and able to store and send data by request from the other computers, responding in that way on tens and hundreds of requests simultaneously. Clients are personal computers of users in the Internet, on which the request can be composed and sent, data can be received and shown. Often, these computers are not connected to the Internet permanently but connect it by need.\r\n</p>', '<h1 class=\"page\">How the Internet works</h1>', '../images/121232.jpg', '<p class=\"page\">All computers in the Interned can be divided on two big groups:  servers and clients.

Clients are personal computers of users in the Internet, on which the request can be composed and sent, data can be received and shown. Often, these computers are not connected to the Internet permanently but connect it by need.</p>', '<p class=\"page\">For connecting the Internet we address to the service of special companies, which have the name Provider of Internet services. Internet Provider is a company that provides access to the Internet through its servers. User computers connect to server by phone lines, channel or wirelessly. In its turn, servers are connected to the Internet by high-speed lines. User computers have appropriate soft, for example, browsers, which compose and send request to a server, then receive and show information on the computer monitor. Server, on its turn, has its own soft that stores information and respond to the requests of client soft.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Let\'s imagine that different users have different computers, on which different operation systems are set (Windows, Vista etc.) with different browsers (Opera, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). Different servers also have different soft. For correct work of programs that were written by different authors with different operation systems Protocols are needed. It is fair to say that Protocols help computer data exchanging. Every Internet service has its own protocol. For example, if you want to send e-mail, your computer must have program and a server must have soft that is appropriate to your program. Appropriate protocol must provide interaction of user\'s program with server. Thereby, for using any Internet services we need:</p>|<ul><li>-computer;\r\n</li><li>-user\'s program that is set on computer and able to work with a service protocol;\r\n</li><li>-server address which has appropriate soft</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">For simplification all aforementioned information let\'s suppose that one person from France want to have conversation with Bill from the USA. For providing communication you have to be sure that two of them know the same language (for example, English). But knowing just basic of the language is not enough. They must be able to organize all words in correct way, according to the rules. Only in that case Bill can understand a person from France. Computers use similar concept when they must find appropriate address. Each computer in the Internet has its unique IP address that has four number sequences from 0 to 255. It is possible to find a computer in any part of the World by using IP. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">If websites, blogs, etc. are part of World Wide Web, then where are they located? How can computer get there? Usually websites are stored on servers, so the servers have extensive disc space, required soft, and ability to respond on tens and hundreds requests simultaneously. For hosting a website in the Internet you need a Provider. Host Provider is a company that provides hosting service,  gives disc space on server for storing websites in the Internet. Remember, that hosting is not a process of website publication but lending of disc space. For finding any website on WWW you need to know IP address of a server, on which a website is stored. There are no problems for computer to remember  IP addresses in the form of number sequences. For people it is more difficult. Domain Name System brings more simplicity to make that work done. This is an alternative address system that understandable for people because computers are assigned not only IP address but also symbolic domain name. Domain name is symbol sequence that divided by period. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Although domain names are very handy for people, computers use number addresses. So for providing interaction between human and machine DNS server service was created. DNS server is a program that performs converting domain name into IP address and opposite. Very likely, you can compare DNS server with the address book on your mobile. We physically cannot remember all numbers that we need. So we write every number on the address book using unique name. For calling we find the name we need and a phone calculate what number must be called. The same method is used on DNS server.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">How can required data be found and transferred? World Wide Web has million different documents that are stored on servers and the task is finding and reading required document. For this, our browser must know exact location of document. All users well know that address consists of short name beginning with disc name and ending with directory names which divided by slash \"/\". So we definitely identify file on computer.\r\nEach file in the Internet also has its unique address. It has a name URL. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is universal resource locator or address of any file on the Internet. Except address of computer URL contains directive about which protocol must be used for requesting a file and what program to use on a server. Commonly, URL address made up of three principal elements: Protocol, Domain name, file path. Let\'s analyze in detail the following URL  http://videofun.com/dns/service/dns-serv.html:\r\n</p>|<ul><li>-http is a protocol. It defines the rules for the interaction between client and server. Protocol has a name HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP;\r\n</li><li>-A domain name of a server follows after that. In our case this is videofun.com., where .com is high level domain;</li>\r\n</li><li>-dns/service/dns-serv.html is a path to our file, which is in directory dns-serv.html.</li></ul>|', '2017-01-20 08:57:21'),

Depression is an abnormal emotional state, which impacts our thinking, emotions, our perception and behavior in different situations. When we are in depression, we are sad about all. A depression is not always triggered by difficult events or situation, changed circumstances. In fact, depression rises when there is no visible reason for it. The life seems to be normal, but you feel yourself awful. Depression erases all colors from your life, makes all less interesting and enjoyable. Depression undermines your energy, motivation and ability to experience joy, pleasure, excitement, satisfaction, affection and love. When you are in depression you become inpatient, loose control of yourself, get angry or upset more quickly and you need more time for getting over all that. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Symptoms of depression</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Professionals consider anyone possessing at least 5 from the following symptoms during continuous period of time as clinically depressed.

You should remember that human being can make errors, be careless and as a result text in the Word can have bad appearance. To see all errors you can type Ctrl+*. This combination of keys makes the program to show all non-printed symbols that usually are hidden from view. Formatting is another common reason of why you have some additional spaces. You can fix this by going to the text setting. If you look at the ribbon on the home tab, you can spot icons with small line placed close to each other on the paragraph group. There are four of them. You can choose the alignment style by typing one of the icons. You can play with them to understand their functions. Actually, it is not very difficult, and makes you feel more accustomed to text alignment in the Word. You can choose to justify a text on a page. In that case, text will be aligned along the left and right margins. So in some cases the spaces between the words can be large, and  text can look slightly strange. For fixing this you can select the paragraph that you want to change and choose left alignment. Another reason for big spacing is typing tab key. You can accidently type the tab key. In that case, you have bigger spacing. Type the combination Ctrl+* for spotting all hidden symbols. In that way, you can understand where on the text you have bigger spacing and what the reason for this. Find and delete the tab characters that look like arrow. \r\n</p>|', '2017-01-30 08:41:05'),

Each application that was downloaded from the Internet can be restored.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What are the options for backing up PC?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can backup the files using two methods: onsite and offsite. First one is using external drive for backup. It is fast and easy. But in the case of fire or robbery you can loose all your data. Offsite backup is when your files are stored in different places, for example, on server. For this backup you can use special services. One example of such service is Crash Plan. Also, you can store your data on external drive and pass it to your friend or put it in bank safe. It will be offsite backup. Finally, you can use cloud service for backing up your files. Each method has its pro and cons. </p>|<p class=\"page\">Backing up files using external drive is the fastest and easiest way. You can use for this any hard drive that is big enough to store all your important file several times. For backup you can use built-in Windows\' utility but it provides you with bare minimum. To do it better use special software that allows to perform full, incremental and differential backup. Each backup has differences. Full backup saves every piece of information, including folders, files, and applications. Differential backups save the files that were changed since the last backup. Good backup applications are Genie Backup Manager, Acronis Backup for PC, Nova BACKUP.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Using online backup service is good option, but it will cost you at least 5$ per month. But if you buy any, you\'ll be provided with all software and automatic backing your files.</p>|<p class=\"page\">To save your money, you can use cloud services like Google Drive, MicrosoftOneDrive, Dropbox. But in that case you can only save your file on the server. These services is not for backup and you  can not have automatic backup, and programs that will be running in background and create point of restoring. Also you have not enough (in the case of using service for free) space for saving all you want.</p>|', '2017-02-05 08:23:42'),

His influence extends far beyond just his plays. His legacy impacted English literature and theatre. The characters of his plays were unforgettable and their monologs brought to the public plenty of famous quotes, which we can use nowadays even without knowing their origin. Just imagine: this man lived four cunturies ago, but his words and phrases are used in our speech. There is no doubts, English would be different without Shakespeare\'s \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Macbeth\" or \"Hamlet\". And for sure, we would not be able to express our thoughts in such a vivid way that we do using modern English. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Standardization of English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Shakespeare lived in the time when language was not standardized. It meant that there were not established grammar, vocabulary and spelling. Obviously, the language had a lack of words and phrases, so the writers of that time were forced to invent them or borrow from other languages. In that situation, Shakespeare tryed to create the greatest of his works. Not only he succeded in that, but did also immensly expanded the scope of English literature. He used different ways for inventing new words and phrases, but the result was always stunning. Sounding from the monologs of colorful characters the words became those words and quotes that we use in our day. Shakespeare\'s significance in the time of great transforming of English was in enriching the language, extending its vocabulary and creating new words and phrases. In time when language was not standardized and had not formed in the way we used to see it now, Shakespeare\'s works had significant impact.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Shakespeare\'s legacy in modern English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Have you ever wonder how many words and phrases that were created by Shakespeare you use in daily life? Unwittingly you can use some of his words or even phrases from his plays. It is amazing how many his quotes are used even in our day. Without some of them our English would be less vivid and diverse. For example, we hardly would describe the scenes of serial killer without the word \"cold-blooded\" and your show about vampires would be less deep. The week could not be eventful without Shakespeare creativity and your wedding is just a stage of your life, but not auspicious occasion on which you wait. Have you ever used the words \"fashionable\" in the collocations like \"a fashionable dress\", \"a fashionable hotel\", \"a fashionable cafe\", \"a fashionable style\"? All these collocations would not be possible without word \"fashionable\" or at least would sound strange. Firstly the word \"fashionable\" emerged in Shakespeare\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\".\r\nThere are many other examples:</p>|<ul><li>-be \"in a pickle\" - means be in trouble;\r\n</li><li>-\"to much of good things\" - means that \"to much of good things\" is not always good for you;\r\n</li><li>\"clothes make the man\" - means that clothes impact the way people will see you as a person;\r\n</li><li>-\"break the ice\" - beginning of conversation with someone who you see the first time;\r\n</li><li>-\"fair play\" - means play while following all rules (in the sport)</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be continued. As you can see from words and phrases, they are used pretty frequently in our daily life, not mention about quotes that are used also very often. </p>|', '2017-02-10 08:18:36'),

It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h1 class=\"page\">How to find and delete duplicate files on your computer</h1>', '../images/885422.jpg', '<p class=\"page\">Each of us at least once stumbled with the problem of slow working computer. It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the duplicate files?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Duplicate files are the files that are copies of other files. Format of files can be different: text, music, picture, etc. Sizes of duplicates can vary.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Why does it happen?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Not only you chip in creating duplicate files on your computer, but Windows also makes identical copies of the same files. It makes operating system more stable and reliable while malware may change some critical files. Some malware can change system files and make your Windows unbootable. For this does not happen Windows has System File Protection. Its main goal is to prevent these changes from harming of operating system and making it unbootable in the end. System File Protection always has a back up of system files, that is, actually, identical copy of files. When some system files are deleted, System File Protection restores the original copies of these files. Many programs also might give duplicate files while installing or updating. It happens because program wants to make itself more reliable by creating its library. For example, some part of library of one program might be identical to the library of another program. But each program wants to install its own version of library, because changes in library (in the case of using the same part of library by two or more programs) might harm another program. It results in creating duplicate files. While updating, apps can also create new versions with  duplicate files. All this changes happen without our knowing and acting. But we also can create duplicate files. We can download the same file twice or copy the same file into different folders, drives.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the solution?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can find duplicate files manually and delete them. But such work is hardly productive and takes your precious time. Also, you cannot quickly distinguish between the files that are similar. But they  might be the copies of the same file, taking free space from your computer. Better solution is using special programs that can find and delete duplicate files. </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the best app to solve the problem?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The app that can find and delete duplicate files must have the following features:</p>|<ul><li>-be free to use or at least have free version that you can use;\r\n</li><li>-be without additional programs like installing toolbar or changing your search engine on browser;\r\n</li><li>-be easy to use;\r\n</li><li>-be free from malware</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">It is obvious there are plenty of different programs out there that you can use for solution to the problem with duplicate files. But you cannot use many of them because they are paid apps or have additional programs. \r\nOne of the programs that you can use for this purpose is dupeGuru. It is free to use and does not install junkware on your computer. It is easy to use and you can quickly understand what to do from beginning. To start your scanning you must add a few folders, and click scan. dupeGuru has dupe Guru Music Edition and dupe Guru Pictures Edition. As their names suggest, each one has its own purpose. You\'ll be much more comfortable when searching duplicate image files by using dupe Guru Pictures Edition. When you want to search for duplicate music files, it is better to use Music Edition.</p>|', '2017-02-22 07:59:38'),

Usual aspect of every modern city like skyscrapers can hardly be seen in Washington, DC. But you can see from almost every place of the city that it consists of squat structures. They are wide but not tall. It becomes more stunning when you think that this is the capital of country which is famous for putting man on the Moon and creating the Internet. To be honest, except one applied for skyscraper, all other modern technologies were used for creating buildings in Washington, DC. As a result, the residents have underground garages and modern offices, but all this is packed in low-height buildings.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">The cause of Washington\'s particular architecture</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The reason the Washington has not tall structures like many other American cities is the Height of Buildings Act that was enacted by Congress in 1910. Actually, before that document there was another version of this paper in 1889. Both of them were created as response to building of Cairo hotel, which had 14 stories. The latest version of act (1910) is valid until these days and restricts the height of any building to be higher than the width of adjacent street plus 20 feet up to a maximum of 90 feet on residential street, 130 feet on commercial street, and 160 feet on a small portion of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Two views on the problem</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Despite that restriction remains in force until these days and most of the buildings were created within the time of its validity, there have been many attempts to remove the Height of Buildings Act. There are many reasons for removing or at least relaxing this document.</p>|<p class=\"page\">In the terms of housing prices, hotel rooms Washington, DC can be at the top of list that represents the most expensive cities. This affects every part of life in the city making it affordable only for those who are related to politic sphere or business. Because of that, working class moves from the city to its neighbor environs. For the same reason tourism struggles to become profitable enough. Deleting any restrictions about height of the buildings would lower prices for hotel rooms and rent of offices allowing more people to move in the city. Having more residents could create more jobs in different areas and low prices for services.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Fans of opposite view have other thoughts about architecture of the city. Modern high buildings create the lists of unwanted inconveniences such as hindering of daylight on the streets, wind tunnels and making the skyline of the city uglier. The absence of skyscrapers in Washington for their view brings to the capital the ambience of Paris.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The future</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Talking about Washington, it\'s worth to mention other capitals like London or Berlin that despite being centers for political life became also business and culture hearts. It\'s obvious that city lacks high building that would make it more business oriented. Whit that, many people would have more opportunities while living in Washington.</p>|', '2017-02-27 07:43:09'),

Maybe, you have already used it for getting to place you needed. It is very helpful and convenient in these cases. But how does it work?</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Global Positioning System</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Global Positioning System or GPS is a network that consists of 30 satellites and broadcasts radio signals with interval. Everyone who has GPS receiver (for example, sell phone) and is located along the lines of sight to at least three satellites can use GPS for navigation or determination location. The more satellites are available for your receiver, the more precise would be data about your location. But once you enter a building, you can lose your contact with GPS. It happens because radio signals can be attenuated by the materials of the buildings like concrete and iron. The signal from GPS in this case will be scattered by the elements of the building: roof, walls, and ceiling.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Indoor solutions</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Because GPS does not work or does not provide required preciseness inside buildings, indoor solutions were invented. It was logically predictable, because at least 80% of their time human beings spend indoors, and Indoor Positioning Systems are in need for many spheres of business. At that time there is no standard technology that is used for such solutions. Different companies try to implement their own solution for this task. Very likely, for such solutions already existing technology will be used. Another important point is that for receiving precise data about location of individual or object more than one technology must be used. Many solutions use Wi-Fi access points for locating and navigating. But in that case data will be precise only if ideal conditions were created, because receiver must be placed on crossing of unobstructed straight lines to three access points. This is in the case a technology uses trilateration for determining location. Other technologies use Bluetooth Low Energy for determining location. For example, an Apple\'s positioning system uses Bluetooth Low Energy to contact transmitters and collect data about location of an object. This technology (iBeacon) requires additional hardware (transmitters) and qualified personals for setting it. No matter what type of technology is used in Indoor Positioning System, it needs precise map of building with determining all floors. In the case of using Wi-Fi access points it needs also precise specifying of those points on map.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Cases for using Indoor Positioning Systems</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Indoor Positioning Systems may be used in the following cases:</p>|<ul><li>-location of individuals or objects;\r</li><li>-navigation;\r</li><li>-helping people with impaired view;\r</li><li>-in emergency cases;\r</li><li>-for enhancing security of a building;\r</li><li>-for providing the customers with just-in-time information they need;\r</li><li>-for guiding customers to places they need;\r</li><li>-for gathering information</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be bigger and using Indoor Positioning Solutions might be beneficial in many other cases. Within some time these technologies have all chances to become as ubiquitous as GPS that was created like military project but became  an important part of our life.</p>|', '2017-03-01 11:02:47');

Back in 1917 Japan artists tried to create first anime. But they had little similarity with what we prefer to watch these days. Without sound, and many frames of animation it was created by drawing characters with chalk. Anime created at the beginning of 20-th Century was destroyed by the following Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and World War II. Most of works were created on cellulose, and as such had not good chances to be saved until this time.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">First steps</h3>|<p class=\"page\">World War II made anime the tool for propaganda. Those animators and studios who didn\'t want to work in that direction were punished and ostracized. But because the society was militarized, anime with propaganda was lucrative during that time. 1945 saw release of full-length anime film Momotaro: Sacred Sailor. After the war Japan anime studios tried to adapt Western style while creating anime. Some of the studios of that time are known until these days. For example, Toie created The Tale of White Serpent in 1958.\r\n </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Osamu Tezuka</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The name of this cartoonist is associated with creating many famous anime that in the following decades set base for modern works. At first Osamu Tezuka work as manga artist, but later he was hired by Toi and animated Son-Goku the Monkey King. After emerging television Tezuka and Mushi Pro created the first anime series with title Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy). The series were about robot who helps to fight alien, criminal and other robots. Series were based on Tezuka\'s manga.\r\n	The work was so successful that it became famous abroad and NBC bought it to show in the USA. Astro Boy had at that time many main features the modern anime has now. For all his works Osamu Tezuka earned the title \"the father of manga\", \"the god of manga\".</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The 1980-th</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The 1980-th is the \"golden age\" of anime. Many anime studios were founded at that time. Anime established itself like distinctive part of Japan culture. Many people whose childhood was within Astro Boy\'s popularity had nostalgia for anime. The VHS gave another reason for popularizing anime.\r\n Our time</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Our time</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Since the beginning of 20-th Century many things have changed. World saw emerging of TV, computer, Internet. Creating anime became quicker and of more quality.

GPS is not just the satellites that move along their orbits. This system consists of three main parts: satellites that were mentioned before, controlling stations that placed on the lend and receivers that take signals and process them.</p>|<p class=\"page\">GPS has 24 satellites that constantly move along their orbits. The altitude at which they are located is about 20000 kilometers. The satellites were positioned at this altitude due to providing maximum covering of the land. At any time and in any place at least four satellites are available to user. Each satellite has atomic clock and transfers radio signals with constant interval and has its own code. GPS receiver can always determine from what satellite the signal was received. The controlling stations on the lend make corrections of satellite orbits and time on their atomic clocks. GPS receiver is any device that has a clock and can receive radio signals from satellites.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">How does it work?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">For positioning GPS receiver must have several data: position of each satellite (from at least four of them), time of receiving and transferring radio signals. Knowing these data allows GPS receiver to calculate location. Clocks on GPS receiver and satellites make possible to compute time of travelling radio signals from satellites to receivers. Receiver can calculate the distances to each satellite that is accessible at that moment by multiplying time on the light velocity. Using method called triangulation GPS receiver can narrow possible location to 1 - 15 meters.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Sources of GPS errors</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Even though GPS was designed to provide navigational accuracy of 10 to 15 meters, it sometimes fails to give precise location of the objects.  Discrepancies in satellites\' atomic clocks can impact the value of distance to satellite. Multipath interferences caused by objects that refract radio signals can make determining location less precise. Ionospheric interferences can make the signals to slow down or speed up. As a user of GPS receiver you can input incorrect date into it. Orbit errors happen because of gravitational pull and solar pressure fluctuation.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">GPS counterparts</h3>|<p class=\"page\">GPS is not the only such system. There are GLONASS (Russian system), Galileo (European Union project) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (China Positioning System). In the beginning, GLONASS was also intended to be just military project. But now it is also available to everyone who wants to use it. Galileo was created as European project only for civilian use.</p>|', '2017-01-14 09:15:14'),

So it is no wonder that the body of an airplane is heated up very quickly to high temperature. Only conditioners can change this situation. This is particularly important for the countries that have hot climate. From some sources the white paint is more expensive than black one, from the others it is chipper. Though it is worth mentioning that metal, which has lighter color is more able to become smeary after some time.\r\nBut there are exceptions. Some airlines propose to fly on airplanes that have different colors, for example, green or yellow. Usually, this just for advertising.\r\nBy the way, military airplane is painted in khaki color.

Internet Provider is a company that provides access to the Internet through its servers. User computers connect to server by phone lines, channel or wirelessly. In its turn, servers are connected to the Internet by high-speed lines. User computers have appropriate soft, for example, browsers, which compose and send request to a server, then receive and show information on the computer monitor. Server, on its turn, has its own soft that stores information and respond to the requests of client soft.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Let\'s imagine that different users have different computers, on which different operation systems are set (Windows, Vista etc.) with different browsers (Opera, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). Different servers also have different soft. For correct work of programs that were written by different authors with different operation systems Protocols are needed. It is fair to say that Protocols help computer data exchanging. Every Internet service has its own protocol. For example, if you want to send e-mail, your computer must have program and a server must have soft that is appropriate to your program. Appropriate protocol must provide interaction of user\'s program with server. Thereby, for using any Internet services we need:</p>|<ul><li>-computer;\r\n</li><li>-user\'s program that is set on computer and able to work with a service protocol;\r\n</li><li>-server address which has appropriate soft</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">For simplification all aforementioned information let\'s suppose that one person from France want to have conversation with Bill from the USA. For providing communication you have to be sure that two of them know the same language (for example, English). But knowing just basic of the language is not enough. They must be able to organize all words in correct way, according to the rules. Only in that case Bill can understand a person from France. Computers use similar concept when they must find appropriate address. Each computer in the Internet has its unique IP address that has four number sequences from 0 to 255.

Remember, that hosting is not a process of website publication but lending of disc space. For finding any website on WWW you need to know IP address of a server, on which a website is stored. There are no problems for computer to remember  IP addresses in the form of number sequences. For people it is more difficult. Domain Name System brings more simplicity to make that work done. This is an alternative address system that understandable for people because computers are assigned not only IP address but also symbolic domain name. Domain name is symbol sequence that divided by period. \r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">Although domain names are very handy for people, computers use number addresses. So for providing interaction between human and machine DNS server service was created. DNS server is a program that performs converting domain name into IP address and opposite. Very likely, you can compare DNS server with the address book on your mobile. We physically cannot remember all numbers that we need. So we write every number on the address book using unique name. For calling we find the name we need and a phone calculate what number must be called. The same method is used on DNS server.\r\n</p>|<p class=\"page\">How can required data be found and transferred? World Wide Web has million different documents that are stored on servers and the task is finding and reading required document. For this, our browser must know exact location of document. All users well know that address consists of short name beginning with disc name and ending with directory names which divided by slash \"/\". So we definitely identify file on computer.\r\nEach file in the Internet also has its unique address. It has a name URL. URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is universal resource locator or address of any file on the Internet. Except address of computer URL contains directive about which protocol must be used for requesting a file and what program to use on a server. Commonly, URL address made up of three principal elements: Protocol, Domain name, file path. Let\'s analyze in detail the following URL  http://videofun.com/dns/service/dns-serv.html:\r\n</p>|<ul><li>-http is a protocol. It defines the rules for the interaction between client and server. Protocol has a name HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP;\r\n</li><li>-A domain name of a server follows after that. In our case this is videofun.com., where .com is high level domain;</li>\r\n</li><li>-dns/service/dns-serv.html is a path to our file, which is in directory dns-serv.html.</li></ul>|', '2017-01-20 08:57:21'),

And this is a big issue. The widespread ignorance of people in this case can lead to neglecting serious psychological disorder, which must be treated. Sadness is a normal human emotion that we all experience in our life on and on.  Usually, sadness is caused by difficulties, complex events or disappointment.  In another words, we are sad about something particular. This is also means that when situation changes and the reason for our emotional pain disappears or we fix the situation or put up with it, a sadness fades away. Depression is an abnormal emotional state, which impacts our thinking, emotions, our perception and behavior in different situations. When we are in depression, we are sad about all. A depression is not always triggered by difficult events or situation, changed circumstances. In fact, depression rises when there is no visible reason for it. The life seems to be normal, but you feel yourself awful. Depression erases all colors from your life, makes all less interesting and enjoyable. Depression undermines your energy, motivation and ability to experience joy, pleasure, excitement, satisfaction, affection and love. When you are in depression you become inpatient, loose control of yourself, get angry or upset more quickly and you need more time for getting over all that. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Symptoms of depression</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Professionals consider anyone possessing at least 5 from the following symptoms during continuous period of time as clinically depressed.

You should remember that human being can make errors, be careless and as a result text in the Word can have bad appearance. To see all errors you can type Ctrl+*. This combination of keys makes the program to show all non-printed symbols that usually are hidden from view. Formatting is another common reason of why you have some additional spaces. You can fix this by going to the text setting. If you look at the ribbon on the home tab, you can spot icons with small line placed close to each other on the paragraph group. There are four of them. You can choose the alignment style by typing one of the icons. You can play with them to understand their functions. Actually, it is not very difficult, and makes you feel more accustomed to text alignment in the Word. You can choose to justify a text on a page. In that case, text will be aligned along the left and right margins. So in some cases the spaces between the words can be large, and  text can look slightly strange. For fixing this you can select the paragraph that you want to change and choose left alignment. Another reason for big spacing is typing tab key. You can accidently type the tab key. In that case, you have bigger spacing. Type the combination Ctrl+* for spotting all hidden symbols. In that way, you can understand where on the text you have bigger spacing and what the reason for this. Find and delete the tab characters that look like arrow. \r\n</p>|', '2017-01-30 08:41:05'),

You can lose your personal files as a result of activity these malicious programs or crash of your hard drive. Even though some people think that this is something that can not happen with them, this is very real. And if you visualize this, you can see that this can be a disaster. To prevent this from happening or (it\'s right to say) to minimize the consequences of loosing your data, you can make backup of the files you think are important for you.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the files  worth backing up?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">When backing up your computer, you might consider the option of storing not all information from your PC. Actually, you must backup only the files that cannot be restored. It can be only your personal files, because other information can be restored from the Internet. But you hardly will be able to restore your photos from travel last year or video from party which was just in one copy on your PC. Each application that was downloaded from the Internet can be restored.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What are the options for backing up PC?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can backup the files using two methods: onsite and offsite. First one is using external drive for backup. It is fast and easy. But in the case of fire or robbery you can loose all your data. Offsite backup is when your files are stored in different places, for example, on server. For this backup you can use special services. One example of such service is Crash Plan. Also, you can store your data on external drive and pass it to your friend or put it in bank safe. It will be offsite backup. Finally, you can use cloud service for backing up your files. Each method has its pro and cons. </p>|<p class=\"page\">Backing up files using external drive is the fastest and easiest way. You can use for this any hard drive that is big enough to store all your important file several times. For backup you can use built-in Windows\' utility but it provides you with bare minimum. To do it better use special software that allows to perform full, incremental and differential backup. Each backup has differences. Full backup saves every piece of information, including folders, files, and applications. Differential backups save the files that were changed since the last backup. Good backup applications are Genie Backup Manager, Acronis Backup for PC, Nova BACKUP.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Using online backup service is good option, but it will cost you at least 5$ per month. But if you buy any, you\'ll be provided with all software and automatic backing your files.</p>|<p class=\"page\">To save your money, you can use cloud services like Google Drive, MicrosoftOneDrive, Dropbox. But in that case you can only save your file on the server. These services is not for backup and you  can not have automatic backup, and programs that will be running in background and create point of restoring. Also you have not enough (in the case of using service for free) space for saving all you want.</p>|', '2017-02-05 08:23:42'),

His influence extends far beyond just his plays. His legacy impacted English literature and theatre. The characters of his plays were unforgettable and their monologs brought to the public plenty of famous quotes, which we can use nowadays even without knowing their origin. Just imagine: this man lived four cunturies ago, but his words and phrases are used in our speech. There is no doubts, English would be different without Shakespeare\'s \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Macbeth\" or \"Hamlet\". And for sure, we would not be able to express our thoughts in such a vivid way that we do using modern English. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">Standardization of English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Shakespeare lived in the time when language was not standardized. It meant that there were not established grammar, vocabulary and spelling. Obviously, the language had a lack of words and phrases, so the writers of that time were forced to invent them or borrow from other languages. In that situation, Shakespeare tryed to create the greatest of his works. Not only he succeded in that, but did also immensly expanded the scope of English literature. He used different ways for inventing new words and phrases, but the result was always stunning. Sounding from the monologs of colorful characters the words became those words and quotes that we use in our day. Shakespeare\'s significance in the time of great transforming of English was in enriching the language, extending its vocabulary and creating new words and phrases. In time when language was not standardized and had not formed in the way we used to see it now, Shakespeare\'s works had significant impact.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Shakespeare\'s legacy in modern English</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Have you ever wonder how many words and phrases that were created by Shakespeare you use in daily life? Unwittingly you can use some of his words or even phrases from his plays. It is amazing how many his quotes are used even in our day. Without some of them our English would be less vivid and diverse. For example, we hardly would describe the scenes of serial killer without the word \"cold-blooded\" and your show about vampires would be less deep. The week could not be eventful without Shakespeare creativity and your wedding is just a stage of your life, but not auspicious occasion on which you wait. Have you ever used the words \"fashionable\" in the collocations like \"a fashionable dress\", \"a fashionable hotel\", \"a fashionable cafe\", \"a fashionable style\"? All these collocations would not be possible without word \"fashionable\" or at least would sound strange. Firstly the word \"fashionable\" emerged in Shakespeare\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\".\r\nThere are many other examples:</p>|<ul><li>-be \"in a pickle\" - means be in trouble;\r\n</li><li>-\"to much of good things\" - means that \"to much of good things\" is not always good for you;\r\n</li><li>\"clothes make the man\" - means that clothes impact the way people will see you as a person;\r\n</li><li>-\"break the ice\" - beginning of conversation with someone who you see the first time;\r\n</li><li>-\"fair play\" - means play while following all rules (in the sport)</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be continued.

It might be because your system is filled out with duplicate files that are stored on different drives and leave less free space. </p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">What are the duplicate files?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Duplicate files are the files that are copies of other files. Format of files can be different: text, music, picture, etc. Sizes of duplicates can vary.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Why does it happen?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Not only you chip in creating duplicate files on your computer, but Windows also makes identical copies of the same files. It makes operating system more stable and reliable while malware may change some critical files. Some malware can change system files and make your Windows unbootable. For this does not happen Windows has System File Protection. Its main goal is to prevent these changes from harming of operating system and making it unbootable in the end. System File Protection always has a back up of system files, that is, actually, identical copy of files. When some system files are deleted, System File Protection restores the original copies of these files. Many programs also might give duplicate files while installing or updating. It happens because program wants to make itself more reliable by creating its library. For example, some part of library of one program might be identical to the library of another program. But each program wants to install its own version of library, because changes in library (in the case of using the same part of library by two or more programs) might harm another program. It results in creating duplicate files. While updating, apps can also create new versions with  duplicate files. All this changes happen without our knowing and acting. But we also can create duplicate files. We can download the same file twice or copy the same file into different folders, drives.\r\n</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the solution?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">You can find duplicate files manually and delete them. But such work is hardly productive and takes your precious time. Also, you cannot quickly distinguish between the files that are similar. But they  might be the copies of the same file, taking free space from your computer. Better solution is using special programs that can find and delete duplicate files. </p>|<h3 class=\"page\">What is the best app to solve the problem?</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The app that can find and delete duplicate files must have the following features:</p>|<ul><li>-be free to use or at least have free version that you can use;\r\n</li><li>-be without additional programs like installing toolbar or changing your search engine on browser;\r\n</li><li>-be easy to use;\r\n</li><li>-be free from malware</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">It is obvious there are plenty of different programs out there that you can use for solution to the problem with duplicate files. But you cannot use many of them because they are paid apps or have additional programs. \r\nOne of the programs that you can use for this purpose is dupeGuru. It is free to use and does not install junkware on your computer. It is easy to use and you can quickly understand what to do from beginning. To start your scanning you must add a few folders, and click scan. dupeGuru has dupe Guru Music Edition and dupe Guru Pictures Edition. As their names suggest, each one has its own purpose. You\'ll be much more comfortable when searching duplicate image files by using dupe Guru Pictures Edition.

To be honest, except one applied for skyscraper, all other modern technologies were used for creating buildings in Washington, DC. As a result, the residents have underground garages and modern offices, but all this is packed in low-height buildings.</p>', '<h3 class=\"page\">The cause of Washington\'s particular architecture</h3>|<p class=\"page\">The reason the Washington has not tall structures like many other American cities is the Height of Buildings Act that was enacted by Congress in 1910. Actually, before that document there was another version of this paper in 1889. Both of them were created as response to building of Cairo hotel, which had 14 stories. The latest version of act (1910) is valid until these days and restricts the height of any building to be higher than the width of adjacent street plus 20 feet up to a maximum of 90 feet on residential street, 130 feet on commercial street, and 160 feet on a small portion of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Two views on the problem</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Despite that restriction remains in force until these days and most of the buildings were created within the time of its validity, there have been many attempts to remove the Height of Buildings Act. There are many reasons for removing or at least relaxing this document.</p>|<p class=\"page\">In the terms of housing prices, hotel rooms Washington, DC can be at the top of list that represents the most expensive cities. This affects every part of life in the city making it affordable only for those who are related to politic sphere or business. Because of that, working class moves from the city to its neighbor environs. For the same reason tourism struggles to become profitable enough. Deleting any restrictions about height of the buildings would lower prices for hotel rooms and rent of offices allowing more people to move in the city. Having more residents could create more jobs in different areas and low prices for services.</p>|<p class=\"page\">Fans of opposite view have other thoughts about architecture of the city. Modern high buildings create the lists of unwanted inconveniences such as hindering of daylight on the streets, wind tunnels and making the skyline of the city uglier. The absence of skyscrapers in Washington for their view brings to the capital the ambience of Paris.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">The future</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Talking about Washington, it\'s worth to mention other capitals like London or Berlin that despite being centers for political life became also business and culture hearts. It\'s obvious that city lacks high building that would make it more business oriented. Whit that, many people would have more opportunities while living in Washington.</p>|', '2017-02-27 07:43:09'),

Everyone who has GPS receiver (for example, sell phone) and is located along the lines of sight to at least three satellites can use GPS for navigation or determination location. The more satellites are available for your receiver, the more precise would be data about your location. But once you enter a building, you can lose your contact with GPS. It happens because radio signals can be attenuated by the materials of the buildings like concrete and iron. The signal from GPS in this case will be scattered by the elements of the building: roof, walls, and ceiling.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Indoor solutions</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Because GPS does not work or does not provide required preciseness inside buildings, indoor solutions were invented. It was logically predictable, because at least 80% of their time human beings spend indoors, and Indoor Positioning Systems are in need for many spheres of business. At that time there is no standard technology that is used for such solutions. Different companies try to implement their own solution for this task. Very likely, for such solutions already existing technology will be used. Another important point is that for receiving precise data about location of individual or object more than one technology must be used. Many solutions use Wi-Fi access points for locating and navigating. But in that case data will be precise only if ideal conditions were created, because receiver must be placed on crossing of unobstructed straight lines to three access points. This is in the case a technology uses trilateration for determining location. Other technologies use Bluetooth Low Energy for determining location. For example, an Apple\'s positioning system uses Bluetooth Low Energy to contact transmitters and collect data about location of an object. This technology (iBeacon) requires additional hardware (transmitters) and qualified personals for setting it. No matter what type of technology is used in Indoor Positioning System, it needs precise map of building with determining all floors. In the case of using Wi-Fi access points it needs also precise specifying of those points on map.</p>|<h3 class=\"page\">Cases for using Indoor Positioning Systems</h3>|<p class=\"page\">Indoor Positioning Systems may be used in the following cases:</p>|<ul><li>-location of individuals or objects;\r</li><li>-navigation;\r</li><li>-helping people with impaired view;\r</li><li>-in emergency cases;\r</li><li>-for enhancing security of a building;\r</li><li>-for providing the customers with just-in-time information they need;\r</li><li>-for guiding customers to places they need;\r</li><li>-for gathering information</li></ul>|<p class=\"page\">This list can be bigger and using Indoor Positioning Solutions might be beneficial in many other cases. Within some time these technologies have all chances to become as ubiquitous as GPS that was created like military project but became  an important part of our life.</p>|', '2017-03-01 11:02:47');
